Mice in Bion-M 1 space mission: training and selection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4136787/,"After a 16-year hiatus, Russia has resumed its program of biomedical research in space, with the successful 30-day flight of the Bion-M 1 biosatellite (April 19–May 19, 2013). The principal species for biomedical research in this project was the mouse. This paper presents an overview of the scientific goals, the experimental design and the mouse training/selection program. The aim of mice experiments in the Bion-M 1 project was to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms, underlying the adaptation of key physiological systems to long-term exposure in microgravity. The studies with mice combined in vivo measurements, both in flight and post-flight (including continuous blood pressure measurement), with extensive in vitro studies carried out shortly after return of the mice and in the end of recovery study. Male C57/BL6 mice group housed in space habitats were flown aboard the Bion-M 1 biosatellite, or remained on ground in the control experiment that replicated environmental and housing conditions in the spacecraft. Vivarium control groups were used to account for housing effects and possible seasonal differences. Mice training included the co-adaptation in housing groups and mice adaptation to paste food diet. The measures taken to co-adapt aggressive male mice in housing groups and the peculiarities of “space” paste food are described. The training program for mice designated for in vivo studies was broader and included behavioral/functional test battery and continuous behavioral measurements in the home-cage. The results of the preliminary tests were used for the selection of homogenous groups. After the flight, mice were in good condition for biomedical studies and displayed signs of pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity. The outcomes of the training program for the mice welfare are discussed. We conclude that our training program was effective and that male mice can be successfully employed in space biomedical research.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fa56/4136787/70e25d36bcd9/pone.0104830.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fa56/4136787/baff4e1e20fe/pone.0104830.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fa56/4136787/b536fa0d195d/pone.0104830.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fa56/4136787/2943f07a32f9/pone.0104830.g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fa56/4136787/551344689a57/pone.0104830.g005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fa56/4136787/624d20564868/pone.0104830.g006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fa56/4136787/6e518b32c174/pone.0104830.g007.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fa56/4136787/899daebf315b/pone.0104830.g008.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
"Microgravity induces pelvic bone loss through osteoclastic activity, osteocytic osteolysis, and osteoblastic cell cycle inhibition by CDKN1a/p21",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3630201/,"Bone is a dynamically remodeled tissue that requires gravity-mediated mechanical stimulation for maintenance of mineral content and structure. Homeostasis in bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. To test this possibility, we exposed 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (n = 8) to microgravity for 15-days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Analysis of the pelvis by µCT shows decreases in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of 6.29%, and bone thickness of 11.91%. TRAP-positive osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces also increased in microgravity by 170% (p = 0.004), indicating osteoclastic bone degeneration. High-resolution X-ray nanoCT studies revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis, including increases in cross-sectional area (+17%, p = 0.022), perimeter (+14%, p = 0.008), and canalicular diameter (+6%, p = 0.037). Expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 1, 3, and 10 in bone, as measured by RT-qPCR, was also up-regulated in microgravity (+12.94, +2.98 and +16.85 fold respectively, p<0.01), with MMP10 localized to osteocytes, and consistent with induction of osteocytic osteolysis. Furthermore, expression of CDKN1a/p21 in bone increased 3.31 fold (p<0.01), and was localized to osteoblasts, possibly inhibiting the cell cycle during tissue regeneration as well as conferring apoptosis resistance to these cells. Finally the apoptosis inducer Trp53 was down-regulated by −1.54 fold (p<0.01), possibly associated with the quiescent survival-promoting function of CDKN1a/p21. In conclusion, our findings identify the pelvic and femoral region of the mouse skeleton as an active site of rapid bone loss in microgravity, and indicate that this loss is not limited to osteoclastic degradation. Therefore, this study offers new evidence for microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis, and CDKN1a/p21-mediated osteogenic cell cycle arrest.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2412/3630201/288e1bc20c04/pone.0061372.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2412/3630201/521982243cb4/pone.0061372.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2412/3630201/be7ca880ab0e/pone.0061372.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2412/3630201/53abeafaf00a/pone.0061372.g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2412/3630201/1935fc86da8d/pone.0061372.g005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2412/3630201/19e052550bb7/pone.0061372.g006.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Stem Cell Health and Tissue Regeneration in Microgravity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11988870/,"Microgravity, defined by minimal gravitational forces, represents a unique environment that profoundly influences biological systems, including human cells. This review examines the effects of microgravity on biological processes and their implications for human health. Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system by disrupting key mechanisms, such as T cell activation, cytokine production, and macrophage differentiation, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. In cancer biology, it promotes the formation of spheroids in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells, which closely mimic in vivo tumor dynamics, providing novel insights for oncology research. Additionally, microgravity enhances tissue regeneration by modulating critical pathways, including Hippo and PI3K-Akt, thereby improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages. At the organ level, microgravity induces notable changes in hepatic metabolism, endothelial function, and bone mechanotransduction, contributing to lipid dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and accelerated bone loss. Notably, cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells and cultured under microgravity exhibit enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium handling, and advanced structural maturation, including increased sarcomere length and nuclear eccentricity. These advancements enable the development of functional cardiomyocytes, presenting promising therapeutic opportunities for treating cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarctions. These findings underscore the dual implications of microgravity for space medicine and terrestrial health. They highlight its potential to drive advances in regenerative therapies, oncology, and immunological interventions. Continued research into the biological effects of microgravity is essential for protecting astronaut health during prolonged space missions and fostering biomedical innovations with transformative applications on Earth.

Microgravity Reduces the Differentiation and Regenerative Potential of Embryonic Stem Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7998608/,"Therapeutic effects of adult stem-cell transplantations are limited by poor cell-retention in target organs, and a reduced potential for optimal cell differentiation compared to embryonic stem cells. However, contemporary studies have indicated heterogeneity within adult stem-cell pools, and a novel culturing technique may address these limitations by selecting those for cell proliferation which are highly functional. Here, we report the preservation of stemness in human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) by using microgravity conditions combined with microspheres in a stirred suspension. The cells were bound to microspheres (100−300 μm) and cultured using a wave-stirring shaker. One-week cultures using polystyrene and collagen microspheres increased the proportions of SSEA-3(+) hASCs 4.4- and 4.3-fold (2.7- and 2.9-fold increases in their numbers), respectively, compared to normal culture conditions. These cultured hASCs expressed higher levels of pluripotent markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, and KLF), and had improved abilities for proliferation, colony formation, network formation, and multiple-mesenchymal differentiation. We believe that this novel culturing method may further enhance regenerative therapies using hASCs.

Microgravity validation of a novel system for RNA isolation and multiplex quantitative real time PCR analysis of gene expression on the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5587110/,"The International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory is dedicated to studying the effects of space on life and physical systems, and to developing new science and technologies for space exploration. A key aspect of achieving these goals is to operate the ISS National Lab more like an Earth-based laboratory, conducting complex end-to-end experimentation, not limited to simple microgravity exposure. Towards that end NASA developed a novel suite of molecular biology laboratory tools, reagents, and methods, named WetLab-2, uniquely designed to operate in microgravity, and to process biological samples for real-time gene expression analysis on-orbit. This includes a novel fluidic RNA Sample Preparation Module and fluid transfer devices, all-in-one lyophilized PCR assays, centrifuge, and a real-time PCR thermal cycler. Here we describe the results from the WetLab-2 validation experiments conducted in microgravity during ISS increment 47/SPX-8. Specifically, quantitative PCR was performed on a concentration series of DNA calibration standards, and Reverse Transcriptase-quantitative PCR was conducted on RNA extracted and purified on-orbit from frozen Escherichia coli and mouse liver tissue. Cycle threshold (Ct) values and PCR efficiencies obtained on-orbit from DNA standards were similar to Earth (1 g) controls. Also, on-orbit multiplex analysis of gene expression from bacterial cells and mammalian tissue RNA samples was successfully conducted in about 3 h, with data transmitted within 2 h of experiment completion. Thermal cycling in microgravity resulted in the trapping of gas bubbles inside septa cap assay tubes, causing small but measurable increases in Ct curve noise and variability. Bubble formation was successfully suppressed in a rapid follow-up on-orbit experiment using standard caps to pressurize PCR tubes and reduce gas release during heating cycles. The WetLab-2 facility now provides a novel operational on-orbit research capability for molecular biology and demonstrates the feasibility of more complex wet bench experiments in the ISS National Lab environment.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/07a1/5587110/4c4530ca68b1/pone.0183480.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/07a1/5587110/7ccfa0af5ff2/pone.0183480.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/07a1/5587110/9908037be98b/pone.0183480.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/07a1/5587110/a658060ef9b7/pone.0183480.g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/07a1/5587110/cbd08822661b/pone.0183480.g005.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Spaceflight Modulates the Expression of Key Oxidative Stress and Cell Cycle Related Genes in Heart,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8396460/,"Spaceflight causes cardiovascular changes due to microgravity-induced redistribution of body fluids and musculoskeletal unloading. Cardiac deconditioning and atrophy on Earth are associated with altered Trp53 and oxidative stress-related pathways, but the effects of spaceflight on cardiac changes at the molecular level are less understood. We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight alters the expression of key genes related to stress response pathways, which may contribute to cardiovascular deconditioning during extended spaceflight. Mice were exposed to spaceflight for 15 days or maintained on Earth (ground control). Ventricle tissue was harvested starting ~3 h post-landing. We measured expression of select genes implicated in oxidative stress pathways and Trp53 signaling by quantitative PCR. Cardiac expression levels of 37 of 168 genes tested were altered after spaceflight. Spaceflight downregulated transcription factor, Nfe2l2 (Nrf2) , upregulated Nox1 and downregulated Ptgs2 , suggesting a persistent increase in oxidative stress-related target genes. Spaceflight also substantially upregulated Cdkn1a ( p21 ) and cell cycle/apoptosis-related gene Myc , and downregulated the inflammatory response gene Tnf . There were no changes in apoptosis-related genes such as Trp53 . Spaceflight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance, cell cycle and senescence in cardiac tissue of mice. Thus, spaceflight may contribute to cardiac dysfunction due to oxidative stress.

Dose- and Ion-Dependent Effects in the Oxidative Stress Response to Space-Like Radiation Exposure in the Skeletal System,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666799/,"Space radiation may pose a risk to skeletal health during subsequent aging. Irradiation acutely stimulates bone remodeling in mice, although the long-term influence of space radiation on bone-forming potential (osteoblastogenesis) and possible adaptive mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation impairs osteoblastogenesis in an ion-type specific manner, with low doses capable of modulating expression of redox-related genes. 16-weeks old, male, C57BL6/J mice were exposed to low linear-energy-transfer (LET) protons (150 MeV/n) or high-LET 56 Fe ions (600 MeV/n) using either low (5 or 10 cGy) or high (50 or 200 cGy) doses at NASA’s Space Radiation Lab. Five weeks or one year after irradiation, tissues were harvested and analyzed by microcomputed tomography for cancellous microarchitecture and cortical geometry. Marrow-derived, adherent cells were grown under osteoblastogenic culture conditions. Cell lysates were analyzed by RT-PCR during the proliferative or mineralizing phase of growth, and differentiation was analyzed by imaging mineralized nodules. As expected, a high dose (200 cGy), but not lower doses, of either 56 Fe or protons caused a loss of cancellous bone volume/total volume. Marrow cells produced mineralized nodules ex vivo regardless of radiation type or dose; 56 Fe (200 cGy) inhibited osteoblastogenesis by more than 90% (5 weeks and 1 year post-IR). After 5 weeks, irradiation (protons or 56 Fe) caused few changes in gene expression levels during osteoblastogenesis, although a high dose 56 Fe (200 cGy) increased Catalase and Gadd45 . The addition of exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) protected marrow-derived osteoprogenitors from the damaging effects of exposure to low-LET ( 137 Cs γ) when irradiated in vitro, but had limited protective effects on high-LET 56 Fe-exposed cells. In sum, either protons or 56 Fe at a relatively high dose (200 cGy) caused persistent bone loss, whereas only high-LET 56 Fe increased redox-related gene expression, albeit to a limited extent, and inhibited osteoblastogenesis. Doses below 50 cGy did not elicit widespread responses in any parameter measured. We conclude that high-LET irradiation at 200 cGy impaired osteoblastogenesis and regulated steady-state gene expression of select redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis, which may contribute to persistent bone loss.

High-precision method for cyclic loading of small-animal vertebrae to assess bone quality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6222041/,"One potentially important bone quality characteristic is the response of bone to cyclic (repetitive) mechanical loading. In small animals, such as in rats and mice, cyclic loading experiments are particularly challenging to perform in a precise manner due to the small size of the bones and difficult-to-eliminate machine compliance. Addressing this issue, we developed a precise method for ex vivo cyclic compressive loading of isolated mouse vertebral bodies. The method has three key characteristics: 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces of the tiny vertebrae; pivotable loading platens to ensure uniform contact and loading of specimen surfaces; and specimen-specific micro-CT-based finite element analysis to measure stiffness to prescribe force levels that produce the same specified level of strain for all test specimens. To demonstrate utility, we measured fatigue life for three groups ( n = 5–6 per group) of L5 vertebrae of C57BL/6J male mice, comparing our new method against two methods commonly used in the literature. We found reduced scatter of the mechanical behavior for this new method compared to the literature methods. In particular, for a controlled level of strain, the standard deviation of the measured fatigue life was up to 5-fold lower for the new method (F-ratio = 4.9; p < 0.01). The improved precision for this new method for biomechanical testing of small-animal vertebrae may help elucidate aspects of bone quality.

Effects of ex vivo ionizing radiation on collagen structure and whole-bone mechanical properties of mouse vertebrae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6813909/,"Bone can become brittle when exposed to ionizing radiation across a wide range of clinically relevant doses that span from radiotherapy (accumulative 50 Gy) to sterilization (~35,000 Gy). While irradiation-induced embrittlement has been attributed to changes in the collagen molecular structure, the relative role of collagen fragmentation versus non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking remains unclear. To better understand the effects of radiation on the bone material without cellular activity, we conducted an ex vivo x-ray radiation experiment on excised mouse lumbar vertebrae. Spinal tissue from twenty-week old, female, C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to a single x-ray radiation dose of either 0 (control), 50, 1,000, 17,000, or 35,000 Gy. Measurements were made for collagen fragmentation, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking, and both monotonic and cyclic-loading compressive mechanical properties. We found that the group differences for mechanical properties were more consistent with those for collagen fragmentation than for non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking. Monotonic strength at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy was lower than that of the control by 50% and 73% respectively, ( p < 0.001) but at 50 and 1,000 Gy was not different than the control. Consistent with those trends, collagen fragmentation only occurred at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy. By contrast, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking was greater than control for all radiation doses ( p < 0.001). All results were consistent both for monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. We conclude that the reductions in bone compressive monotonic strength and fatigue life due to ex vivo ionizing radiation are more likely caused by fragmentation of the collagen backbone than any increases in non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks.

TNO1 is involved in salt tolerance and vacuolar trafficking in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3177255/,"The Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor SYP41 is involved in vesicle fusion at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and interacts with AtVPS45, SYP61, and VTI12. These proteins are involved in diverse cellular processes, including vacuole biogenesis and stress tolerance. A previously uncharacterized protein, named TNO1 (for TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), was identified by coimmunoprecipitation as a SYP41-interacting protein. TNO1 was found to localize to the TGN by immunofluorescence microscopy. A tno1 mutant showed increased sensitivity to high concentrations of NaCl, KCl, and LiCl and also to mannitol-induced osmotic stress. Localization of SYP61, which is involved in the salt stress response, was disrupted in the tno1 mutant. Vacuolar proteins were partially secreted to the apoplast in the tno1 mutant, suggesting that TNO1 is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. The tno1 mutant had delayed formation of the brefeldin A (BFA) compartment in cotyledons upon application of BFA, suggesting less efficient membrane fusion processes in the mutant. Unlike most TGN proteins, TNO1 does not relocate to the BFA compartment upon BFA treatment. These data demonstrate that TNO1 is involved in vacuolar trafficking and salt tolerance, potentially via roles in vesicle fusion and in maintaining TGN structure or identity.
The plant vacuole is a versatile organelle that has important functions, including maintaining turgor, ion homeostasis, compartmentalizing toxic material, accumulating defense compounds, and storing and degrading proteins ( Marty, 1999 ). To maintain these functions, correct transport of vacuolar proteins is required. Vacuolar proteins are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and are transported cotranslationally into the ER lumen. From the ER, they are transported to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) via the Golgi ( Törmäkangas et al., 2001 ). In the TGN, vacuolar proteins with sequence-specific vacuolar sorting determinants are thought to be recognized by vacuolar sorting receptors (VSRs; Kirsch et al., 1994 ; Ahmed et al., 2000 ; daSilva et al., 2005 ), although a recent report has suggested that recognition of cargo by VSRs may occur as early as the ER ( Niemes et al., 2010 ). Storage proteins with C-terminal sorting sequences are also bound by VSRs or by a second putative sorting receptor, RMR1 ( Jiang et al., 2000 ; Shimada et al., 2003a ; Park et al., 2005 , 2007 ; Hinz et al., 2007 ). After the receptors recognize their cargo, vacuolar proteins are transported to the prevacuolar compartment (PVC; Sanderfoot et al., 1998 ; Happel et al., 2004 ; Song et al., 2006 ) before transport on to the vacuole. In mammalian cells, cargo receptors are recycled from their destination to the site of cargo binding ( Seaman, 2005 ). VSR1 was found to localize to the TGN and the PVC ( Paris et al., 1997 ; Sanderfoot et al., 1998 ); thus, VSR1 was also suggested to cycle between these organelles.
Soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) are integral membrane proteins required for the fusion of vesicles with their target membrane. SNAREs can be classified based on their site of function: v (vesicle)-SNAREs are localized to the vesicle membrane, and t (target)-SNAREs are localized to the target membrane ( Rothman, 1994 ; Søgaard et al., 1994 ). Generally, one v-SNARE on the vesicle and three t-SNAREs on the target membrane form a trans-SNARE complex, bringing the two membranes in contact and driving membrane fusion ( McNew et al., 2000 ). Clathrin-coated vesicles containing VSR1 contain the v-SNARE VTI11, which forms a SNARE complex with SYP5, SYP2, and VAMP727 at the PVC during anterograde trafficking from the TGN ( Kirsch et al., 1994 ; Sanderfoot et al., 2001a ; Ebine et al., 2008 ). However, the mechanism of recycling of VSR1 from the PVC to the TGN is not yet fully understood. A complex containing the SNAREs SYP41, SYP61, and VTI12 and the Sec1/Munc18-like protein AtVPS45, a potential regulator of vesicle fusion ( Dulubova et al., 2002 ; Bryant and James, 2003 ), is found at the TGN in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ; Bassham and Raikhel, 1998 ; Bassham et al., 2000 ). SNAREs in the SYP41 complex, along with another SNARE, YKT61/62, were found to be sufficient for vesicle fusion in vitro ( Chen et al., 2005 ). Recently, AtVPS45 was suggested to be involved in the recycling of VSR1, as RNA interference knockdown of AtVPS45 expression causes mislocalization of VSR1 ( Zouhar et al., 2009 ).
SYP41 and SYP42 are highly homologous t-SNAREs with 62% amino acid sequence identity. However, they form separate complexes with AtVPS45 in different subdomains of the TGN ( Bassham et al., 2000 ) and are not functionally redundant, as individual syp41 and syp42 knockout mutants are gametophytic lethal ( Sanderfoot et al., 2001b ). A mutation in SYP61, another t-SNARE in the SYP41 complex ( Zhu et al., 2002 ), caused defects in osmotic stress tolerance and abscisic acid regulation of stomatal responses. The v-SNARE VTI12 is involved in trafficking of storage proteins ( Sanmartín et al., 2007 ) and a vti12 mutant showed an early-senescence phenotype under starvation conditions, suggesting that VTI12 is also involved in the autophagy pathway for the degradation of cellular contents ( Surpin et al., 2003 ). In addition to their function together in vesicle fusion, components of the SYP41 complex therefore also appear to be involved in distinct processes, suggesting that they may function in additional SNARE complexes.
In this study, we identified a novel SYP41-interacting protein that we named TNO1 (for TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein). TNO1 is a membrane protein at the TGN and is required for efficient vacuolar trafficking, consistent with the hypothesis that it functions together with the SYP41 SNARE complex. A tno1 knockout mutant has a salt and osmotic stress-sensitive phenotype, possibly due to the partial mislocalization of SYP61. A brefeldin A (BFA)-treated tno1 mutant showed a delay in formation of the BFA compartment, indicating that TNO1 could be important in TGN/endosome fusion events. We propose that TNO1 is involved in vacuolar trafficking and salt stress resistance by facilitating the vesicle fusion process.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plntphys.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9d2b/3177255/d779a01615e7/PP_168963_gs_f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9d2b/3177255/9c3e8bdb1385/PP_168963_gs_f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9d2b/3177255/b128e862380d/PP_168963_wc_f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9d2b/3177255/c68728f09c25/PP_168963_gs_f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9d2b/3177255/b94d3d769f84/PP_168963_wc_f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9d2b/3177255/25bc135641a5/PP_168963_wc_f6.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9d2b/3177255/45bddbb55d37/PP_168963_gs_f7.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9d2b/3177255/12e24bbefaa4/PP_168963_wc_f8.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Functional redundancy between trans-Golgi network SNARE family members in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11500582/,"SNAREs play an important role in the process of membrane trafficking. In the present research, we investigated subcellular localization of an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana protein reported to interact with a trans -Golgi network-localized Qa-SNARE, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS 43. Based on the similarity of its amino acid sequence to metazoan fucosyltransferases, we have named this novel protein AtGTLP ( Arabidopsis thaliana G lycosyl T ransferase- L ike P rotein) and predicted that it should be a member of yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis fucosyltransferases, as it shows no significant sequence similarity to fucosyltransferases previously identified in Arabidopsis. AtGTLP is a membrane-anchored protein, which exhibits a type II-like topology, with a single transmembrane helix and a globular domain in the C-terminal part of its amino acid sequence. Colocalization data we collected suggest that AtGTLP should localize mainly to Golgi apparatus, especially to certain zones of trans -Golgi. As single atgtlp−/− mutants showed no obvious difference in phenotype (primary root length and fresh mass), AtGTLP and proteins related to AtGTLP with high similarity in amino acid sequences may have redundant functions.

Gravitropism and lateral root emergence are dependent on the trans-Golgi network protein TNO1,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4642138/,"The trans -Golgi network (TGN) is a dynamic organelle that functions as a relay station for receiving endocytosed cargo, directing secretory cargo, and trafficking to the vacuole. TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1) is a large, TGN-localized, coiled-coil protein that associates with the membrane fusion protein SYP41, a target SNARE, and is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. Here, we show that a tno1 mutant has auxin transport-related defects. Mutant roots have delayed lateral root emergence, decreased gravitropic bending of plant organs and increased sensitivity to the auxin analog 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the natural auxin 3-indoleacetic acid. Auxin asymmetry at the tips of elongating stage II lateral roots was reduced in the tno1 mutant, suggesting a role for TNO1 in cellular auxin transport during lateral root emergence. During gravistimulation, tno1 roots exhibited delayed auxin transport from the columella to the basal epidermal cells. Endocytosis to the TGN was unaffected in the mutant, indicating that bulk endocytic defects are not responsible for the observed phenotypes. Together these studies demonstrate a role for TNO1 in mediating auxin responses during root development and gravistimulation, potentially through trafficking of auxin transport proteins.

The Drosophila SUN protein Spag4 cooperates with the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin to maintain association of the basal body and spermatid nucleus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2915878/,"Maintaining the proximity of centrosomes to nuclei is important in several cellular contexts, and LINC complexes formed by SUN and KASH proteins are crucial in this process. Here, we characterize the presumed Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian SUN protein, sperm-associated antigen 4 (Spag4, previously named Giacomo), and demonstrate that Spag4 is required for centriole and nuclear attachment during spermatogenesis. Production of spag4 mRNA is limited to the testis, and Spag4 protein shows a dynamic pattern of association with the germline nuclei, including a concentration of protein at the site of attachment of the single spermatid centriole. In the absence of Spag4, nuclei and centrioles or basal bodies (BBs) dissociate from each other after meiosis. This role of Spag4 in centriolar attachment does not involve either of the two KASH proteins of the Drosophila genome (Klarsicht and MSP-300), but does require the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin. Yuri shows an identical pattern of localization at the nuclear surface to Spag4 during spermatogenesis, and epistasis studies show that the activities of Yuri and dynein-dynactin are downstream of spag4 in this centriole attachment pathway. The later defects in spermatogenesis seen for yuri and spag4 mutants are similar, suggesting they could be secondary to initial disruption of events at the nuclear surface.

Toll mediated infection response is altered by gravity and spaceflight in Drosophila,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3901686/,"Space travel presents unlimited opportunities for exploration and discovery, but requires better understanding of the biological consequences of long-term exposure to spaceflight. Immune function in particular is relevant for space travel. Human immune responses are weakened in space, with increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections and immune-related conditions. In addition, microorganisms can become more virulent in space, causing further challenges to health. To understand these issues better and to contribute to design of effective countermeasures, we used the Drosophila model of innate immunity to study immune responses in both hypergravity and spaceflight. Focusing on infections mediated through the conserved Toll and Imd signaling pathways, we found that hypergravity improves resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infections except in a known gravitaxis mutant of the yuri gagarin gene. These results led to the first spaceflight project on Drosophila immunity, in which flies that developed to adulthood in microgravity were assessed for immune responses by transcription profiling on return to Earth. Spaceflight alone altered transcription, producing activation of the heat shock stress system. Space flies subsequently infected by fungus failed to activate the Toll pathway. In contrast, bacterial infection produced normal activation of the Imd pathway. We speculate on possible linkage between functional Toll signaling and the heat shock chaperone system. Our major findings are that hypergravity and spaceflight have opposing effects, and that spaceflight produces stress-related transcriptional responses and results in a specific inability to mount a Toll-mediated infection response.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ca4f/3901686/82a34ab55629/pone.0086485.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ca4f/3901686/9f026319922a/pone.0086485.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ca4f/3901686/df91c729501f/pone.0086485.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ca4f/3901686/3ffac3fe17d0/pone.0086485.g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ca4f/3901686/864f3cb46863/pone.0086485.g005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ca4f/3901686/38c460506eb9/pone.0086485.g006.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

GeneLab database analyses suggest long-term impact of space radiation on the cardiovascular system by the activation of FYN through reactive oxygen species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6387434/,"Space radiation has recently been considered a risk factor for astronauts’ cardiac health. As an example, for the case of how to query and identify datasets within NASA’s GeneLab database and demonstrate the database utility, we used an unbiased systems biology method for identifying key genes/drivers for the contribution of space radiation on the cardiovascular system. This knowledge can contribute to designing appropriate experiments targeting these specific pathways. Microarray data from cardiomyocytes of male C57BL/6 mice followed-up for 28 days after exposure to 900 mGy of 1 GeV proton or 150 mGy of 1 GeV/n 56 Fe were compared to human endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured for 7 days on the International Space Station (ISS). We observed common molecular pathways between simulated space radiation and HUVECs flown on the ISS. The analysis suggests FYN is the central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation: the known oxidative stress induced immediately following radiation would only be transient and would upregulate FYN , which in turn would reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, protecting the cardiovascular system. The transcriptomic signature of exposure to protons was also much closer to the spaceflight signature than 56 Fe’s signature. To our knowledge, this is the first time GeneLab datasets were utilized to provide potential biological indications that the majority of ions on the ISS are protons, clearly illustrating the power of omics analysis. More generally, this work also demonstrates how to combine animal radiation studies done on the ground and spaceflight studies to evaluate human risk in space.

FAIRness and usability for open-access omics data systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6371294/,"Omics data sharing is crucial to the biological research community, and the last decade or two has seen a huge rise in collaborative analysis systems, databases, and knowledge bases for omics and other systems biology data. We assessed the “FAIRness” of NASA’s GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) along with four similar kinds of systems in the research omics data domain, using 14 FAIRness metrics. The range of overall FAIRness scores was 6-12 (out of 14), average 10.1, and standard deviation 2.4. The range of Pass ratings for the metrics was 29-79%, Partial Pass 0-21%, and Fail 7-50%. The systems we evaluated performed the best in the areas of data findability and accessibility, and worst in the area of data interoperability. Reusability of metadata, in particular, was frequently not well supported. We relate our experiences implementing semantic integration of omics data from some of the assessed systems for federated querying and retrieval functions, given their shortcomings in data interoperability. Finally, we propose two new principles that Big Data system developers, in particular, should consider for maximizing data accessibility.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-procamia.gif"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/876e/6371294/1368a790dfe7/2975810f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/876e/6371294/402a007044f3/2975810f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/876e/6371294/56f23a3d8fc1/2975810t1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/876e/6371294/d93bd3cb9ffc/2975810f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/876e/6371294/61da22a426fb/2975810t2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/876e/6371294/4a2378083d7d/2975810f4.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
NASA GeneLab platform utilized for biological response to space radiation in animal models,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7072278/,"Background: Ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) is one of the major risk factors that will impact the health of astronauts on extended missions outside the protective effects of the Earth’s magnetic field. The NASA GeneLab project has detailed information on radiation exposure using animal models with curated dosimetry information for spaceflight experiments. Methods: We analyzed multiple GeneLab omics datasets associated with both ground-based and spaceflight radiation studies that included in vivo and in vitro approaches. A range of ions from protons to iron particles with doses from 0.1 to 1.0 Gy for ground studies, as well as samples flown in low Earth orbit (LEO) with total doses of 1.0 mGy to 30 mGy, were utilized. Results: From this analysis, we were able to identify distinct biological signatures associating specific ions with specific biological responses due to radiation exposure in space. For example, we discovered changes in mitochondrial function, ribosomal assembly, and immune pathways as a function of dose. Conclusions: We provided a summary of how the GeneLab’s rich database of omics experiments with animal models can be used to generate novel hypotheses to better understand human health risks from GCR exposures.

Extraterrestrial Gynecology: Could Spaceflight Increase the Risk of Developing Cancer in Female Astronauts? An Updated Review,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9267413/,"Outer space is an extremely hostile environment for human life, with ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays and microgravity posing the most significant hazards to the health of astronauts. Spaceflight has also been shown to have an impact on established cancer hallmarks, possibly increasing carcinogenic risk. Terrestrially, women have a higher incidence of radiation-induced cancers, largely driven by lung, thyroid, breast, and ovarian cancers, and therefore, historically, they have been permitted to spend significantly less time in space than men. In the present review, we focus on the effects of microgravity and radiation on the female reproductive system, particularly gynecological cancer.

Chromosomal positioning and epigenetic architecture influence DNA methylation patterns triggered by galactic cosmic radiation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10789781/,"Despite surging interest in space travel in recent decades, the impacts of prolonged, elevated exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on human health remain poorly understood. This form of ionizing radiation causes significant changes to biological systems including damage to DNA structure by altering epigenetic phenotype with emphasis on DNA methylation. Building on previous work by Kennedy et al. (Sci Rep 8(1): 6709. 10.1038/S41598-018-24755-8), we evaluated spatial DNA methylation patterns triggered by high-LET ( 56 Fe, 28 Si) and low-LET (X-ray) radiation and the influence of chromosome positioning and epigenetic architecture in distinct radial layers of cell nucleus. Next, we validated our results using gene expression data of mice irradiated with simulated GCR and JAXA astronauts. We showed that primarily 56 Fe induces a persistent DNA methylation increase whereas 28 Si and X-ray induce a decrease DNA methylation which is not persistent with time. Moreover, we highlighted the role of nuclear chromatin architecture in cell response to external radiation. In summary, our study provides novel insights towards epigenetic and transcriptomic response as well as chromatin multidimensional structure influence on galactic cosmic radiation damage.

The betacoronavirus continues to evolve with global health implications as we race to learn more to curb its transmission, evolution, and sequelae. The focus of this review, the second of a three-part series, is on the biological effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on post-acute disease in the context of tissue and organ adaptations and damage. We highlight the current knowledge and describe how virological, animal, and clinical studies have shed light on the mechanisms driving the varied clinical diagnoses and observations of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we describe how investigations into SARS-CoV-2 effects have informed the understanding of viral pathogenesis and provide innovative pathways for future research on the mechanisms of viral diseases.

Aging and putative frailty biomarkers are altered by spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166946/,"Human space exploration poses inherent risks to astronauts’ health, leading to molecular changes that can significantly impact their well-being. These alterations encompass genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased inflammation, homeostatic dysregulation, and various epigenomic changes. Remarkably, these changes bear similarities to those observed during the aging process on Earth. However, our understanding of the connection between these molecular shifts and disease development in space remains limited. Frailty syndrome, a clinical syndrome associated with biological aging, has not been comprehensively investigated during spaceflight. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged murine data obtained from NASA’s GeneLab, along with astronaut data gathered from the JAXA and Inspiration4 missions. Our objective was to assess the presence of biological markers and pathways related to frailty, aging, and sarcopenia within the spaceflight context. Through our analysis, we identified notable changes in gene expression patterns that may be indicative of the development of a frailty-like condition during space missions. These findings suggest that the parallels between spaceflight and the aging process may extend to encompass frailty as well. Consequently, further investigations exploring the utility of a frailty index in monitoring astronaut health appear to be warranted.

Space radiation damage rescued by inhibition of key spaceflight associated miRNAs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166944/,"Our previous research revealed a key microRNA signature that is associated with spaceflight that can be used as a biomarker and to develop countermeasure treatments to mitigate the damage caused by space radiation. Here, we expand on this work to determine the biological factors rescued by the countermeasure treatment. We performed RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic analysis on 3D microvessel cell cultures exposed to simulated deep space radiation (0.5 Gy of Galactic Cosmic Radiation) with and without the antagonists to three microRNAs: miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p ( i.e ., antagomirs). Significant reduction of inflammation and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) activity and rescue of mitochondria functions are observed after antagomir treatment. Using data from astronaut participants in the NASA Twin Study, Inspiration4, and JAXA missions, we reveal the genes and pathways implicated in the action of these antagomirs are altered in humans. Our findings indicate a countermeasure strategy that can potentially be utilized by astronauts in spaceflight missions to mitigate space radiation damage.

Innate immune responses of Drosophila melanogaster are altered by spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7000411/,"While it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex environment. Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll , suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized.

Regulation of plant gravity sensing and signaling by the actin cytoskeleton.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8716943/,"Primary root growth is required by the plant to anchor in the soil and reach out for nutrients and water, while dealing with obstacles. Efficient root elongation and bending depends upon the coordinated action of environmental sensing, signal transduction, and growth responses. The actin cytoskeleton is a highly plastic network that constitutes a point of integration for environmental stimuli and hormonal pathways. In this review, we present a detailed compilation highlighting the importance of the actin cytoskeleton during primary root growth and we describe how actin-binding proteins, plant hormones, and actin-disrupting drugs affect root growth and root actin. We also discuss the feedback loop between actin and root responses to light and gravity. Actin affects cell division and elongation through the control of its own organization. We remark upon the importance of longitudinally oriented actin bundles as a hallmark of cell elongation as well as the role of the actin cytoskeleton in protein trafficking and vacuolar reshaping during this process. The actin network is shaped by a plethora of actin-binding proteins; however, there is still a large gap in connecting the molecular function of these proteins with their developmental effects. Here, we summarize their function and known effects on primary root growth with a focus on their high level of specialization. Light and gravity are key factors that help us understand root growth directionality. The response of the root to gravity relies on hormonal, particularly auxin, homeostasis, and the actin cytoskeleton. Actin is necessary for the perception of the gravity stimulus via the repositioning of sedimenting statoliths, but it is also involved in mediating the growth response via the trafficking of auxin transporters and cell elongation. Furthermore, auxin and auxin analogs can affect the composition of the actin network, indicating a potential feedback loop. Light, in its turn, affects actin organization and hence, root growth, although its precise role remains largely unknown. Recently, fundamental studies with the latest techniques have given us more in-depth knowledge of the role and organization of actin in the coordination of root growth; however, there remains a lot to discover, especially in how actin organization helps cell shaping, and therefore root growth.

HLB1 Is a Tetratricopeptide Repeat Domain-Containing Protein That Operates at the Intersection of the Exocytic and Endocytic Pathways at the TGN/EE in Arabidopsis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4826010/,"The endomembrane system plays essential roles in plant development, but the proteome responsible for its function and organization remains largely uncharacterized in plants. Here, we identified and characterized the HYPERSENSITIVE TO LATRUNCULIN B1 (HLB1) protein isolated through a forward-genetic screen in Arabidopsis thaliana for mutants with heightened sensitivity to actin-disrupting drugs. HLB1 is a plant-specific tetratricopeptide repeat domain-containing protein of unknown function encoded by a single Arabidopsis gene. HLB1 associated with the trans -Golgi network ( TGN )/early endosome ( EE ) and tracked along filamentous actin, indicating that it could link post-Golgi traffic with the actin cytoskeleton in plants. HLB1 was found to interact with the ADP-ribosylation-factor guanine nucleotide exchange factor, MIN7/BEN1 (HOPM INTERACTOR7/BREFELDIN A-VISUALIZED ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING DEFECTIVE1) by coimmunoprecipitation. The min7/ben1 mutant phenocopied the mild root developmental defects and latrunculin B hypersensitivity of hlb1 , and analyses of a hlb1/ min7/ben1 double mutant showed that hlb1 and min7/ben1 operate in common genetic pathways. Based on these data, we propose that HLB1 together with MIN7/BEN1 form a complex with actin to modulate the function of the TGN / EE at the intersection of the exocytic and endocytic pathways in plants.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plntcell.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4bed/4826010/95fd353b9a32/PC_TPC201500794RAR2_f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4bed/4826010/dea6f98db090/PC_TPC201500794RAR2_f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4bed/4826010/50f6a019c61e/PC_TPC201500794RAR2_f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4bed/4826010/173972e260d3/PC_TPC201500794RAR2_f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4bed/4826010/6a427009659a/PC_TPC201500794RAR2_f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4bed/4826010/1657e54124b8/PC_TPC201500794RAR2_f6.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4bed/4826010/46351a479a88/PC_TPC201500794RAR2_f7.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4bed/4826010/ba768a8083dc/PC_TPC201500794RAR2_f8.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4bed/4826010/671b3f7e6966/PC_TPC201500794RAR2_f9.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4bed/4826010/3a50cd370ddf/PC_TPC201500794RAR2_f10.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4bed/4826010/2ecfc477e536/PC_TPC201500794RAR2_f11.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4bed/4826010/1b82f32905e2/PC_TPC201500794RAR2_f12.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

Brassinosteroids inhibit autotropic root straightening by modifying filamentous-actin organization and dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7010715/,"When positioned horizontally, roots grow down toward the direction of gravity. This phenomenon, called gravitropism, is influenced by most of the major plant hormones including brassinosteroids. Epi-brassinolide (eBL) was previously shown to enhance root gravitropism, a phenomenon similar to the response of roots exposed to the actin inhibitor, latrunculin B (LatB). This led us to hypothesize that eBL might enhance root gravitropism through its effects on filamentous-actin (F-actin). This hypothesis was tested by comparing gravitropic responses of maize ( Zea mays ) roots treated with eBL or LatB. LatB- and eBL-treated roots displayed similar enhanced downward growth compared with controls when vertical roots were oriented horizontally. Moreover, the effects of the two compounds on root growth directionality were more striking on a slowly-rotating two-dimensional clinostat. Both compounds inhibited autotropism, a process in which the root straightened after the initial gravistimulus was withdrawn by clinorotation. Although eBL reduced F-actin density in chemically-fixed Z. mays roots, the impact was not as strong as that of LatB. Modification of F-actin organization after treatment with both compounds was also observed in living roots of barrel medic ( Medicago truncatula ) seedlings expressing genetically encoded F-actin reporters. Like in fixed Z. mays roots, eBL effects on F-actin in living M. truncatula roots were modest compared with those of LatB. Furthermore, live cell imaging revealed a decrease in global F-actin dynamics in hypocotyls of etiolated M. truncatula seedlings treated with eBL compared to controls. Collectively, our data indicate that eBL-and LatB-induced enhancement of root gravitropism can be explained by inhibited autotropic root straightening, and that eBL affects this process, in part, by modifying F-actin organization and dynamics.

Cell type-specific imaging of calcium signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana seedling roots using GCaMP3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7503278/,"Cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca 2+ ] cyt ) is a well-characterized second messenger in eukaryotic cells. An elevation in [Ca 2+ ] cyt levels is one of the earliest responses in plant cells after exposure to a range of environmental stimuli. Advances in understanding the role of [Ca 2+ ] cyt in plant development has been facilitated by the use of genetically-encoded reporters such as GCaMP. Most of these studies have relied on promoters such as Cauliflower Mosaic Virus ( 35S ) and Ubiquitin10 ( UBQ10 ) to drive expression of GCaMP in all cell/tissue types. Plant organs such as roots consist of various cell types that likely exhibit unique [Ca 2+ ] cyt responses to exogenous and endogenous signals. However, few studies have addressed this question. Here, we introduce a set of Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing GCaMP3 in five root cell types including the columella, endodermis, cortex, epidermis, and trichoblasts. We found similarities and differences in the [Ca 2+ ] cyt signature among these root cell types when exposed to adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP), glutamate, aluminum, and salt, which are known to trigger [Ca 2+ ] cyt increases in root cells. These cell type-targeted GCaMP3 lines provide a new resource that should enable more in depth studies that address how a particular environmental stimulus is linked to specific root developmental pathways via [Ca 2+ ] cyt .

Spatial and temporal localization of SPIRRIG and WAVE/SCAR reveal roles for these proteins in actin-mediated root hair development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8364238/,"Root hairs are single-cell protrusions that enable roots to optimize nutrient and water acquisition. These structures attain their tubular shapes by confining growth to the cell apex, a process called tip growth. The actin cytoskeleton and endomembrane systems are essential for tip growth; however, little is known about how these cellular components coordinate their activities during this process. Here, we show that SPIRRIG (SPI), a beige and Chediak Higashi domain-containing protein involved in membrane trafficking, and BRK1 and SCAR2, subunits of the WAVE/SCAR (W/SC) actin nucleating promoting complex, display polarized localizations in Arabidopsis thaliana root hairs during distinct developmental stages. SPI accumulates at the root hair apex via post-Golgi compartments and positively regulates tip growth by maintaining tip-focused vesicle secretion and filamentous-actin integrity. BRK1 and SCAR2 on the other hand, mark the root hair initiation domain to specify the position of root hair emergence. Consistent with the localization data, tip growth was reduced in spi and the position of root hair emergence was disrupted in brk1 and scar1234 . BRK1 depletion coincided with SPI accumulation as root hairs transitioned from initiation to tip growth. Taken together, our work uncovers a role for SPI in facilitating actin-dependent root hair development in Arabidopsis through pathways that might intersect with W/SC.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plntcell.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/cfce/8364238/5cb9dd061be4/koab115f8.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/cfce/8364238/b548154e9f05/koab115f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/cfce/8364238/48e9eb5db0a9/koab115f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/cfce/8364238/77dcc47bd59f/koab115f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/cfce/8364238/a84fd0136b0e/koab115f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/cfce/8364238/ab05f8f501cd/koab115f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/cfce/8364238/4151d03e74aa/koab115f6.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Microgravity Stress: Bone and Connective Tissue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11579474/,"Long-duration spaceflight creates a variety of stresses due to the unique environment, which can lead to compromised functioning of the skeletal and immune systems. However, the mechanisms by which organisms respond to this stress remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of three different gravitational loadings (microgravity, 1/6 g [lunar gravity], and 1 g ) on the behavior, bone, thymus, and spleen of mice housed for 25–35 days in the International Space Station. The bone density reduction under microgravity was mostly recovered by 1 g but only partially recovered by 1/6 g . Both 1 g and 1/6 g suppressed microgravity-induced changes in some osteoblast and osteoclast marker gene expression. Thymus atrophy induced by microgravity was half recovered by both 1 g and 1/6 g , but gene expression changes were not fully recovered by 1/6 g . While no histological changes were observed due to low gravity, alterations in gene expression were noted in the spleen. We found that in bone and thymus, lunar gravity reduced microgravity-induced histological alterations and partially reversed gene expression changes. This study highlighted organ-specific variations in responsiveness to gravity, serving as an animal test for establishing a molecular-level gravity threshold for maintaining a healthy state during future spaceflight.

S. aureus MscL is a pentamer in vivo but of variable stoichiometries in vitro: implications for detergent-solubilized membrane proteins,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2998437/,"While the bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is the best studied biological mechanosensor and serves as a paradigm for how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension, the simple matter of its oligomeric state has led to debate, with models ranging from tetramers to hexamers. Indeed, two different oligomeric states of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL have been resolved by X-ray crystallography: The M. tuberculosis channel (MtMscL) is a pentamer, while the S. aureus protein (SaMscL) forms a tetramer. Because several studies suggest that, like MtMscL, the E. coli MscL (EcoMscL) is a pentamer, we re-investigated the oligomeric state of SaMscL. To determine the structural organization of MscL in the cell membrane we developed a disulfide-trapping approach. Surprisingly, we found that virtually all SaMscL channels in vivo are pentameric, indicating this as the physiologically relevant and functional oligomeric state. Complementing our in vivo results, we purified SaMscL and assessed its oligomeric state using three independent approaches (sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, crosslinking, and light scattering) and established that SaMscL is a pentamer when solubilized in Triton X-100 and C 8 E 5 detergents. However, performing similar experiments on SaMscL solubilized in LDAO, the detergent used in the crystallographic study, confirmed the tetrameric oligomerization resolved by X-ray crystallography. We further demonstrate that this stoichiometric shift is reversible by conventional detergent exchange experiments. Our results firmly establish the pentameric organization of SaMscL in vivo. Furthermore they demonstrate that detergents can alter the subunit stoichiometry of membrane protein complexes in vitro; thus, in vivo assays are necessary to firmly establish a membrane protein's true functionally relevant oligomeric state.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosbiol.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8e33/2998437/fe2ef5a72403/pbio.1000555.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8e33/2998437/7c1037cd54d4/pbio.1000555.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8e33/2998437/8de34c1e57ce/pbio.1000555.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8e33/2998437/6f7302a3692b/pbio.1000555.g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8e33/2998437/e493ae495bef/pbio.1000555.g005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8e33/2998437/e54a207998f9/pbio.1000555.e001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8e33/2998437/8485b0298955/pbio.1000555.e002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8e33/2998437/c2f09937b05d/pbio.1000555.e003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8e33/2998437/cf3ff1e4b67e/pbio.1000555.e004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8e33/2998437/27f2bd8fd046/pbio.1000555.e005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8e33/2998437/c2f09937b05d/pbio.1000555.e006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8e33/2998437/cf3ff1e4b67e/pbio.1000555.e007.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8e33/2998437/6fc22f801b74/pbio.1000555.e008.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8e33/2998437/348af5018125/pbio.1000555.e009.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8e33/2998437/348af5018125/pbio.1000555.e010.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8e33/2998437/55f98b81bbb7/pbio.1000555.e011.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8e33/2998437/a0dbe1e9d508/pbio.1000555.e012.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Manipulating the permeation of charged compounds through the MscL nanovalve.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3005423/,"MscL is a bacterial mechanosensor that serves as a biological emergency release valve, releasing cytoplasmic solutes to the environment on osmotic downshock. Previous studies have recognized that this channel has properties that make it ideal for use as a triggered nanovalve for vesicular-based targeted drug-release devices. One can even change the modality of the sensor. Briefly, the introduction of charges into the MscL pore lumen gates the channel in the absence of membrane tension; thus, by inserting compounds that acquire a charge on exposure to an alternative stimulus, such as light or pH, into the pore of the channel, controllable nanoswitches that detect these alternative modalities have been engineered. However, a charge in the pore lumen could not only encourage actuation of the nanopore but also have a significant influence on the permeation of large charged compounds, which would thus have important implications for the efficiency of drug-release devices. In this study, we used in vivo and electrophysiological approaches to demonstrate that the introduction of a charge into pore lumen of MscL does indeed influence the permeation of charged molecules. These effects were more drastic for larger compounds and, surprisingly, were related to the orientation of the MscL channel in the membrane.—Yang, L-M, Blount, P.

The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is found in the cytoplasmic membrane of most bacteria ( 1 ), where it plays a vital role in osmoregulation by protecting the cell from lysis on acute decreases in external osmotic environment by releasing cytoplasmic osmolytes ( 2 ), thus serving as a biological “emergency release valve.” It has remained one of the best studied and most understood of mechanosensitive channels. A MscL homologue from Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been resolved by X-ray crystallography and shown to be of simple architecture: a homopentamer, with each subunit containing 2 transmembrane α helices and a cytoplasmic α helical bundle ( 3 ). The first transmembrane domain, TM1, forms the pore of the channel, while the second transmembrane domain, TM2, is exposed to the lipid bilayer. In response to tension in cell membrane, both TM1 and TM2 expand, and this expansion ultimately leads to channel opening, with TM1 largely forming the pore lumen ( 4 – 7 ).
Several previous studies have recognized that this channel has many properties that would make it ideal for use in vesicular-based targeted drug-release nanodevices. It has a very large pore size (30–40 Å; ref. 8 ); thus, when gated, the nanopore would allow large compounds to be released. Furthermore, it can be translated in vitro ( 9 ) or synthetically synthesized ( 10 ), reconstituted into lipids, and yet spontaneously assemble into a functional complex. Moreover, introduction of charges into the MscL pore lumen can gate the channel in the absence of membrane tension ( 5 , 11 , 12 ). This approach has allowed for the engineering of controllable nanopores, or nanoswitches that detect alternative modalities, including light ( 13 ) and pH ( 14 ). To perform this technique, compounds that acquire charges in response to these stimuli are inserted chemically, by thiol reactions to unique cysteines substituted by site-directed mutagenesis, into the pore of the channel. However, a charge in the pore lumen might not only encourage actuation of the nanopore but also influence the permeation of charged molecules. In this study, we used in vivo efflux assays and patch-clamp approaches to address this question.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-fasebj.gif"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6973/3005423/c29f19e932fc/z380011181150001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6973/3005423/12833fa61a82/z380011181150002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6973/3005423/bfbcd241b9d3/z380011181150003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6973/3005423/d71adbcc8893/z380011181150004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6973/3005423/41c7ffd3d4be/z380011181150005.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
The oligomeric state of the truncated mechanosensitive channel of large conductance shows no variance in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3190158/,"The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from E. coli serves as an emergency release valve allowing the cell to survive acute osmotic downshock. It is one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels and serves as a paradigm for how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension. Two MscL crystal structures of the orthologs M. tuberculosis and S. aureus have been solved showing pentameric and tetrameric structures, respectively. Several studies followed to understand whether the discrepancy in their stoichiometry was a species difference or a consequence of the protein manipulation for crystallization. Two independent studies now agree that the full-length S. aureus MscL is actually a pentamer, not tetramer. While detergents appear to play a role in modifying the oligomeric state of the protein, a cytoplasmic helical bundle has also been implicated. Here, we evaluate the role of the C-terminal region of S. aureus MscL in the oligomerization of the channel in native membranes by using an in vivo disulfide-trapping technique. We find that the oligomeric state of S. aureus MscLs with different C-terminal truncations, including the one used to obtain the tetrameric S. aureus MscL crystal structure, are pentamers in vivo . Thus, the C-terminal domain of the S. aureus protein only plays a critical role in the oligomeric state of the SaMscL protein when it is solubilized in detergent.

Three routes to modulate the pore size of the MscL channel/nanovalve,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3289768/,"MscL is a bacterial mechanosensitive channel that protects cells from lysis upon acute decrease in external osmotic environment. It is one of the best characterized mechanosensors known, thus serving as a paradigm of how such molecules sense and respond to stimuli. In addition, the fact that it can be genetically modified, expressed, isolated, and manipulated has led to its proposed use as a triggered nanovalve for various functions including sensors within microelectronic array chips, as well as vesicular-based targeted drug release. X-ray crystallography reveals a homo-pentameric complex with each subunit containing two transmembrane α-helices (TM1 and TM2) and a single carboxyl terminal α-helix arranging within the complex to form a five-fold cytoplasmic bundle (CB), whose function and stability remain unclear. In this study, we show three routes that throttle the open channel conductance. When the linker between the TM2 and CB domain is shortened by deletions or constrained by either cross linking or heavy metal coordination, the conductance of the channel is reduced; in later two cases, even reversibly. While having implications for the stability of the CB, these data also provide routes for engineering MscL sensors that are more versatile for potential nanotech devices.

The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, is a bacterial channel located in the cytoplasmic membrane that protects cells from lysis upon acute decrease in external osmotic environment by releasing cytoplasmic osmolytes. 1 This channel was first identified in E. coli , and most functional studies have been undertaken in this species. A MscL homologue from Mycobacterium tuberculosis , which has 67% similarity, has been resolved by X-ray crystallography and shown to be a homopentamer, with each subunit containing two transmembrane α helices (TM1 and TM2), of which TM1 forms the pore of the channel and TM2 is exposed to the lipid bilayer. 2 Although a more recent crystal structure of MscL from S. aureus shows a tetrameric complex, 3 this appears to be a detergent-specific oligomeric organization not reflecting a physiological state; in vivo essentially all channels are pentameric. 4 – 5 The pentameric channel opens by the expansion of both TM1 and TM2 in response to tension in cell membrane. 6 – 11 The channel also contains a single carboxyl terminal α helix from each subunit that together assemble into a 5-helix cytoplasmic bundle (CB). 2 It remains unclear what the function of the CB is, and whether or to what extent the bundle is dissociated during channel gating.
Previous studies have shown that the E. coli MscL channel has a very large pore size, greater than 30Å, 12 which has caused some researchers to speculate that it could be used in nanodevices. Indeed, it has many properties that would make it ideal for use as a triggered nanovalve in such devices. It can be translated in vitro 13 or synthetically synthesized, reconstituted into lipids, and yet spontaneously assemble into a functional complex. 14 Since introduction of charges into the channel pore lumen can gate the channel in the absence of membrane tension, 7 , 15 – 18 E. coli MscL has been engineered into controllable nanovalves that detect alternative modalities including light 19 and pH. 20 The channel has been shown to be functional in vesicular-release devices, 19 – 21 as well as in an engineered microelectronic array chip; 22 its large pore size yields a robust response in such devices. However, for some purposes a smaller or adjustable pore size would be of advantage.
The data presented within this study on E. coli MscL have two aspects: first, they resolve the issue of whether the CB disassociates upon normal channel opening, and second, they demonstrate that the MscL nanopore response can be effectively and reversibly modulated, which would have advantages in an assortment of potential nanodevices.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-nihpa.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/379a/3289768/abea99099264/nihms347401f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/379a/3289768/c3af35ba4e96/nihms347401f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/379a/3289768/ea46136b59d6/nihms347401f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/379a/3289768/d2c9592c05a7/nihms347401f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/379a/3289768/356e3ba5169b/nihms347401f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/379a/3289768/cad1bec8c9f5/nihms347401f6.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
The dynamics of protein-protein interactions between domains of MscL at the cytoplasmic-lipid interface,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3508904/,"The bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, is one of the best characterized mechanosensitive channels serving as a paradigm for how proteins can sense and transduce mechanical forces. The physiological role of MscL is that of an emergency release valve that opens a large pore upon a sudden drop in the osmolarity of the environment. A crystal structure of a closed state of MscL shows it as a homopentamer, with each subunit consisting of two transmembrane domains (TM). There is consensus that the TM helices move in an iris like manner tilting in the plane of the membrane while gating. An N-terminal amphipathic helix that lies along the cytoplasmic membrane (S1), and the portion of TM2 near the cytoplasmic interface (TM2 ci ), are relatively close in the crystal structure, yet predicted to be dynamic upon gating. Here we determine how these two regions interact in the channel complex, and study how these interactions change as the channel opens. We have screened 143 double-cysteine mutants of E. coli MscL for their efficiency in disulfide bridging and generated a map of protein-protein interactions between these two regions. Interesting candidates have been further studied by patch clamp and show differences in channel activity under different redox potentials; the results suggest a model for the dynamics of these two domains during MscL gating.

The MscS and MscL families of mechanosensitive channels act as microbial emergency release valves,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3430326/,"Single-celled organisms must survive exposure to environmental extremes. Perhaps one of the most variable and potentially life-threatening changes that can occur is that of a rapid and acute decrease in external osmolarity. This easily translates into several atmospheres of additional pressure that can build up within the cell. Without a protective mechanism against such pressures, the cell will lyse. Hence, most microbes appear to possess members of one or both families of bacterial mechanosensitive channels, MscS and MscL, which can act as biological emergency release valves that allow cytoplasmic solutes to be jettisoned rapidly from the cell. While this is undoubtedly a function of these proteins, the discovery of the presence of MscS homologues in plant organelles and MscL in fungus and mycoplasma genomes may complicate this simplistic interpretation of the physiology underlying these proteins. Here we compare and contrast these two mechanosensitive channel families, discuss their potential physiological roles, and review some of the most relevant data that underlie the current models for their structure and function.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-jbacter.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9c90/3430326/98f28e736369/zjb9990917610001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9c90/3430326/46b01c6e62f5/zjb9990917610002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9c90/3430326/725cc07faf4f/zjb9990917610003.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

Tardigrades Use Intrinsically Disordered Proteins to Survive Desiccation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11127935/,"Tardigrades, microscopic animals that survive a broad range of environmental stresses, express a unique set of proteins termed tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs). TDPs are often expressed at high levels in tardigrades upon desiccation, and appear to mediate stress adaptation. Here, we focus on the proteins belonging to the secreted family of tardigrade proteins termed secretory-abundant heat soluble (“SAHS”) proteins, and investigate their ability to protect diverse biological structures. Recombinantly expressed SAHS proteins prevent desiccated liposomes from fusion, and enhance desiccation tolerance of E. coli and Rhizobium tropici upon extracellular application. Molecular dynamics simulation and comparative structural analysis suggest a model by which SAHS proteins may undergo a structural transition upon desiccation, in which removal of water and solutes from a large internal cavity in SAHS proteins destabilizes the beta-sheet structure. These results highlight the potential application of SAHS proteins as stabilizing molecules for preservation of cells.

The biology of tardigrade disordered proteins in extreme stress tolerance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11930778/,"Anhydrobiosis, a phenomenon in which organisms survive extreme dehydration by entering a reversible ametabolic state, is a remarkable example of survival strategies. This study focuses on anhydrobiosis in tardigrades, which are known for their resilience to severe environmental conditions. Tardigrades utilize several protective mechanisms against desiccation, notably the constitutive expression of cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins in Ramazzottius varieornatus . These proteins share similarities in their amphiphatic alpha helices with late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, but differ significantly in their amino acid sequences. In this study, we further explored the functionality of CAHS proteins by analyzing their role in aggregation and tolerance to hyperosmotic stress in mammalian cells. Using live cell imaging, we examined the subcellular localization of several CAHS and LEA proteins in response to hyperosmotic stress. The expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 tended to enhance the resilience to the hyperosmotic conditions.

Production of reactive oxygen species and involvement of bioprotectants during anhydrobiosis in the tardigrade Paramacrobiotus spatialis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8816950/,"Water unavailability is an abiotic stress causing unfavourable conditions for life. Nevertheless, some animals evolved anhydrobiosis, a strategy allowing for the reversible organism dehydration and suspension of metabolism as a direct response to habitat desiccation. Anhydrobiotic animals undergo biochemical changes synthesizing bioprotectants to help combat desiccation stresses. One stress is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, the eutardigrade Paramacrobiotus spatialis was used to investigate the occurrence of ROS associated with the desiccation process. We observed that the production of ROS significantly increases as a function of time spent in anhydrobiosis and represents a direct demonstration of oxidative stress in tardigrades. The degree of involvement of bioprotectants, including those combating ROS, in the P. spatialis was evaluated by perturbing their gene functions using RNA interference and assessing the successful recovery of animals after desiccation/rehydration. Targeting the glutathione peroxidase gene compromised survival during drying and rehydration, providing evidence for the role of the gene in desiccation tolerance. Targeting genes encoding glutathione reductase and catalase indicated that these molecules play roles during rehydration. Our study also confirms the involvement of aquaporins 3 and 10 during rehydration. Therefore, desiccation tolerance depends on the synergistic action of many different molecules working together.

Partial weight suspension: A novel murine model for investigating adaptation to reduced musculoskeletal loading.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3774184/,"We developed a new model of hypodynamic loading to support mice in chronic conditions of partial weight bearing, enabling simulations of reduced gravity environments and related clinical conditions. The novel hardware allows for reduced loading between 10 and 80% of normal body weight on all four limbs and enables characteristic quadrupedal locomotion. Ten-week-old female BALB/cByJ mice were supported for 21 days under Mars-analog suspension (38% weight bearing) and compared with age-matched and jacketed (100% weight bearing) controls. After an initial adaptation, weight gain did not differ between groups, suggesting low levels of animal stress. Relative to age-matched controls, mice exposed to Mars-analog loading had significantly lower muscle mass (−23% gastrocnemius wet mass, P < 0.0001); trabecular and cortical bone morphology (i.e., trabecular bone volume: −24% at the distal femur, and cortical thickness: −11% at the femoral midshaft, both P < 0.001); and biomechanical properties of the femoral midshaft (i.e., −27% ultimate moment, P < 0.001). Bone formation indexes were decreased compared with age-matched full-weight-bearing mice, whereas resorption parameters were largely unchanged. Singly housed, full-weight-bearing controls with forelimb jackets were largely similar to age-matched, group-housed controls, although a few variables differed and warrant further investigation. Altogether, these data provide strong rationale for use of our new model of partial weight bearing to further explore the musculoskeletal response to reduced loading environments.

musculoskeletal deconditioning associated with spaceflight has been noted since the early days of the Gemini program. Despite rigorous exercise protocols and other countermeasures, negative calcium balance (∼0.5%/mo) and bone loss in weight-bearing bones (1.0–2.7%/mo) are still the hallmarks of flight ( 12 – 15 , 29 ). Although the mechanisms of disuse-induced bone loss and age-related bone loss are not identical, a 20% decline in femoral neck bone mineral density during a single year of spaceflight corresponds to 30 yr of age-related bone loss in a postmenopausal woman, bringing with it a significant increase in fracture risk ( 16 ). Furthermore, subject-specific finite-element analyses indicate that femoral bone strength declines by 2%/mo during spaceflight, with some astronauts exhibiting reductions in proximal femoral strength that are comparable to estimated lifetime losses in bone strength associated with aging ( 11 ).
Whereas human spaceflight over the last 30 yr has been confined exclusively to low Earth orbit, and largely to flights of less than 6 mo, exploration goals once again reach beyond the Van Allen belts. Although the physiological effects of weightlessness are well described, the effects of chronic partial weight bearing, such as expected on the moon (16% of Earth's gravity) and Mars (38% of Earth's gravity), have yet to be quantified. In these environments, the risks of musculoskeletal atrophy and accompanying orthopedic injury are uncertain, and methods to further investigate adaptations to partial weight bearing are needed.
Based on the paradigm that mechanical loading provides the primary stimulus for skeletal maintenance ( 4 , 10 , 24 ), it is likely that partial weight bearing will provide some prophylaxis against the deconditioning seen in conditions of full disuse. But how do adaptive processes scale with changes in gravitational loading? Does a given decrease in gravitational acceleration lead to a proportionate decrease in bone and muscle mass, or is this response curve nonlinear? The answers to these questions are important, not only for aerospace physiology, but also for a better understanding of the effects of reduced weight bearing associated with clinical conditions and diseases.
Accordingly, the objectives of this study were to develop a new rodent model of partial weight suspension (PWS) to explore these musculoskeletal effects of chronically reduced weight bearing and to conduct the first study of musculoskeletal adaptation to Mars gravity levels. We hypothesized that musculoskeletal adaptation to partial weight bearing would replicate the key features of adaptation to full unloading, including reduced bone formation rate, muscle mass, bone mass, and bone strength.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-jap.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bb26/3774184/0c402af1d59f/zdg0081091700001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bb26/3774184/62a15f506594/zdg0081091700002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bb26/3774184/39c35c0a2fab/zdg0081091700003.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
"Partial reductions in mechanical loading yield proportional changes in bone density, bone architecture, and muscle mass",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4118556/,"Although the musculoskeletal system is known to be sensitive to changes in its mechanical environment, the relationship between functional adaptation and below-normal mechanical stimuli is not well defined. We investigated bone and muscle adaptation to a range of reduced loading using the partial weight suspension (PWS) system, in which a two-point harness is used to offload a tunable amount of body weight while maintaining quadrupedal locomotion. Skeletally mature female C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to partial weight bearing at 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 21 days. A hindlimb unloaded (HLU) group was included for comparison in addition to age-matched controls in normal housing. Gait kinematics was measured across the full range of weight bearing, and some minor alterations in gait from PWS were identified. With PWS, bone and muscle changes were generally proportional to the degree of unloading. Specifically, total body and hindlimb bone mineral density, calf muscle mass, trabecular bone volume of the distal femur, and cortical area of the femur midshaft were all linearly related to the degree of unloading. Even a load reduction to 70% of normal weight bearing was associated with significant bone deterioration and muscle atrophy. Weight bearing at 20% did not lead to better bone outcomes than HLU despite less muscle atrophy and presumably greater mechanical stimulus, requiring further investigation. These data confirm that the PWS model is highly effective in applying controllable, reduced, long-term loading that produces predictable, discrete adaptive changes in muscle and bone of the hindlimb.

Spaceflight Activates Lipotoxic Pathways in Mouse Liver,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6915713/,"Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on the physiology of astronauts, many of which are recapitulated in rodent models. Mouse studies performed on the Space Shuttle showed disruption of lipid metabolism in liver. However, given that these animals were not sacrificed on-orbit and instead returned live to earth, it is unclear if these disruptions were solely induced by space stressors (e.g. microgravity, space radiation) or in part explained by the stress of return to Earth. In this work we analyzed three liver datasets from two different strains of mice (C57BL/6 (Jackson) & BALB/c (Taconic)) flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, these animals were sacrificed on-orbit and exposed to varying spaceflight durations (i.e. 21, 37, and 42 days vs 13 days for the Shuttle mice). Oil Red O (ORO) staining showed abnormal lipid accumulation in all space-flown mice compared to ground controls regardless of strain or exposure duration. Similarly, transcriptomic analysis by RNA-sequencing revealed several pathways that were affected in both strains related to increased lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, lipid and fatty acid processing, lipid catabolic processing, and lipid localization. In addition, key upstream regulators were predicted to be commonly regulated across all conditions including Glucagon (GCG) and Insulin (INS). Moreover, quantitative proteomic analysis showed that a number of lipid related proteins were changed in the livers during spaceflight. Taken together, these data indicate that activation of lipotoxic pathways are the result of space stressors alone and this activation occurs in various genetic backgrounds during spaceflight exposures of weeks to months. If similar responses occur in humans, a prolonged change of these pathways may result in the development of liver disease and should be investigated further.

RNAseq and RNA molecular barcoding reveal differential gene expression in cortical bone following hindlimb unloading in female mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8509868/,"Disuse-induced bone loss is seen following spinal cord injury, prolonged bed rest, and exposure to microgravity. We performed whole transcriptomic profiling of cortical bone using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and RNA molecular barcoding (NanoString) on a hindlimb unloading (HLU) mouse model to identify genes whose mRNA transcript abundances change in response to disuse. Eleven-week old female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to ambulatory loading or HLU for 7 days (n = 8/group). Total RNA from marrow-flushed femoral cortical bone was analyzed on HiSeq and NanoString platforms. The expression of several previously reported genes associated with Wnt signaling and metabolism was altered by HLU. Furthermore, the increased abundance of transcripts, such as Pfkfb3 and Mss51, after HLU imply these genes also have roles in the cortical bone’s response to altered mechanical loading. Our study demonstrates that an unbiased approach to assess the whole transcriptomic profile of cortical bone can reveal previously unidentified mechanosensitive genes and may eventually lead to novel targets to prevent disuse-induced osteoporosis.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7e22/8509868/279c8c1e1155/pone.0250715.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7e22/8509868/d42738713900/pone.0250715.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7e22/8509868/6d5c9141ee13/pone.0250715.g003.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Proteomic and phosphoproteomic characterization of cardiovascular tissues after long term exposure to simulated space radiation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11063234/,"Introduction: It may take decades to develop cardiovascular dysfunction following exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation from medical therapy or from nuclear accidents. Since astronauts may be exposed continually to a complex space radiation environment unlike that experienced on Earth, it is unresolved whether there is a risk to cardiovascular health during long-term space exploration missions. Previously, we have described that mice exposed to a single dose of simplified Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR 5-ion ) develop cardiovascular dysfunction by 12 months post-radiation.
Methods: To investigate the biological basis of this dysfunction, here we performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from these mice at 8 months post-radiation.
Results: Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) for irradiated versus sham irradiated samples (fold-change ≥1.2 and an adjusted p -value of ≤0.05) were identified for each proteomics data set. For the heart proteome, there were 87 significant DEPs (11 upregulated and 76 downregulated); for the heart phosphoproteome, there were 60 significant differentially phosphorylated peptides (17 upregulated and 43 downregulated); and for the plasma proteome, there was only one upregulated protein. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) technique that assesses canonical pathways from BIOCARTA, KEGG, PID, REACTOME, and WikiPathways revealed significant perturbation in pathways in each data set. For the heart proteome, 166 pathways were significantly altered (36 upregulated and 130 downregulated); for the plasma proteome, there were 73 pathways significantly altered (25 upregulated and 48 downregulated); and for the phosphoproteome, there were 223 pathways significantly affected at 0.1 adjusted p -value cutoff. Pathways related to inflammation were the most highly perturbed in the heart and plasma. In line with sustained inflammation, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were demonstrated to be increased in GCR 5-ion irradiated hearts at 12-month post irradiation. NETs play a fundamental role in combating bacterial pathogens, modulating inflammatory responses, inflicting damage on healthy tissues, and escalating vascular thrombosis.
Discussion: These findings suggest that a single exposure to GCR 5-ion results in long-lasting changes in the proteome and that these proteomic changes can potentiate acute and chronic health issues for astronauts, such as what we have previously described with late cardiac dysfunction in these mice.

Adaptive Changes in the Vestibular System of Land Snail to a 30-Day Spaceflight and Readaptation on Return to Earth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5672023/,"The vestibular system receives a permanent influence from gravity and reflexively controls equilibrium. If we assume gravity has remained constant during the species' evolution, will its sensory system adapt to abrupt loss of that force? We address this question in the land snail Helix lucorum exposed to 30 days of near weightlessness aboard the Bion-M1 satellite, and studied geotactic behavior of postflight snails, differential gene expressions in statocyst transcriptome, and electrophysiological responses of mechanoreceptors to applied tilts. Each approach revealed plastic changes in the snail's vestibular system assumed in response to spaceflight. Absence of light during the mission also affected statocyst physiology, as revealed by comparison to dark-conditioned control groups. Readaptation to normal tilt responses occurred at ~20 h following return to Earth. Despite the permanence of gravity, the snail responded in a compensatory manner to its loss and readapted once gravity was restored.

"Morphology of the Utricular Otolith Organ in the Toadfish, Opsanus tau",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5899691/,"The utricle provides the vestibular reflex pathways with the sensory codes of inertial acceleration of self motion and head orientation with respect to gravity to control balance and equilibrium. Here we present an anatomical description of this structure in the adult oyster toadfish, and establish a morphological basis for interpretation of subsequent functional studies. Light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques were applied to visualize the sensory epithelium at varying levels of detail, its neural innervation and its synaptic organization. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize otolith mass and morphological polarization patterns of hair cells. Afferent nerve fibers were visualized following labeling with biocytin, and light microscope images were used to make three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of individual labeled afferents to identify dendritic morphology with respect to epithelial location. Transmission electron micrographs were compiled to create a serial 3-D reconstruction of a labeled afferent over a segment of its dendritic field and to examine the cell-afferent synaptic contacts. Major observations are: a well-defined striola, medial and lateral extra-striolar regions with a zonal organization of hair bundles; prominent lacinia projecting laterally; dependence of hair cell density on macular location; narrow afferent dendritic fields that follow the hair bundle polarization; synaptic specializations issued by afferents are typically directed towards a limited number of 7–13 hair cells, but larger dendritic fields in the medial extra-striola can be associated with > 20 hair cells also; and hair cell synaptic bodies can be confined to only an individual afferent or can synapse upon several afferents.

"Influence of Magnitude and Duration of Altered Gravity and Readaptation to 1g on the Structure and Function of the Utricle in Toadfish, Opsanus tau.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6204554/,"Gravity has remained constant during animal evolution and the neural sensory systems detecting acceleration forces have remained remarkably conserved among vertebrates. The utricular organ senses the sum of inertial force due to head translation and head tilt relative to gravitational vertical. Change in gravitational force would be expected to have profound effects on how an organism maintains equilibrium. We characterize the physiology of utricular afferents to applied accelerations in the oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau , in normal 1 g to establish benchmarks, after 1–32-day exposures to 2.24 g (resultant) via centrifugation (hypergravity, HG), after 4- and 16-day exposures to 1.12 g (resultant), and following 1–8 days recovery to HG exposures to study re-adaptation to 1 g. Afferents were also examined during activation of efferent vestibular pathway. Centrifugation at 2.24 g included 228°/s constant angular velocity component, and thus horizontal canal afferent responses to yaw rotation were recorded as an internal control in each fish. Afferents studied after 228°/s rotation for 4 and 16 days without centripetal acceleration, called On-Center-Control, were indistinguishable from their control counterparts. Principal response to HG was an adjustment of afferent sensitivity as a function of magnitude and duration of exposure: an initial robust increase at 3–4 days followed by a significant decrease from 16 to 32 days. Initial increase observed after 4 days of HG took >4 days in 1 g to recover, and the decrease observed after 16 days of HG took >2 days to readapt to 1 g. Hair cells in striola and medial extrastriola macula regions were serially reconstructed in 3D from thin sections using transmission electron microscopy in control fish and fish exposed to 4 and 16 days of HG. Despite the highly significant differences in afferent physiology, synaptic body counts quantified in the same fish were equivalent in their inter-animal variability and averages. No clear role of the efferent pathway as a feedback mechanism regulating afferent behavior to HG was found. Transfer from 1 g to HG imparts profound effects on gravitational sensitivity of utricular afferents and the accompanying transfer from the HG back to the 1 g resembles in part (as an analog) the transfer from 1 g to the micrograms.

Organization of the ER-Golgi interface for membrane traffic control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4064004/,"Coat protein complex I (COPI) and COPII are required for bidirectional membrane trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi. While these core coat machineries and other transport factors are highly conserved across species, high-resolution imaging studies indicate that the organization of the ER–Golgi interface is varied in eukaryotic cells. Regulation of COPII assembly, in some cases to manage distinct cellular cargo, is emerging as one important component in determining this structure. Comparison of the ER–Golgi interface across different systems, particularly mammalian and plant cells, reveals fundamental elements and distinct organization of this interface. A better understanding of how these interfaces are regulated to meet varying cellular secretory demands should provide key insights into the mechanisms that control efficient trafficking of proteins and lipids through the secretory pathway.
The secretory pathway in eukaryotic cells is responsible for biogenesis and proper intracellular distribution of a wide range of proteins, complex carbohydrates and lipids. Trafficking in the secretory pathway is highly dynamic and responsive to specific cellular functional demands. Forward transport (also known as anterograde transport) of newly synthesized proteins and lipids is initiated at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and, as such, ER-to-Golgi transport represents a vital gateway to the endomembrane system.
Membrane traffic between the ER and the Golgi is bidirectional and occurs via similar mechanisms. In both cases, a carrier forms on the donor organelle and then tethers to and fuses with the target organelle ( FIG. 1 ). Distinct machineries facilitate the formation of carriers for anterograde and retrograde transport, which are thought to ensure fidelity and directionality of trafficking: coat protein complex II (COPII) operates in the anterograde pathway from the ER, and COPI functions in the retrograde route from the Golgi. Although in vitro studies suggest that the formation of COPI- and COPII-coated carriers is mechanistically similar and can occur via the action of minimal components (including heteromeric coat complexes, ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) and SAR1 (secretion-associated RAS-related 1) GTPases and their regulatory guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) ( BOX 1 ; BOX 2 ), other elements are necessary to coordinate the two trafficking routes in vivo and thereby maintain organelle structure and function. This is supported by evidence demonstrating that chemical disruption of the COPI route with the ARF GEF inhibitor brefeldin A leads to the collapse of ER export 1 , 2 , which may be due to depletion of proteins required for the formation of COPII carriers that occurs because Golgi-to-ER retrieval is blocked. Similarly, dominantnegative versions of SAR1 that block COPII assembly rapidly disrupt Golgi structure and function 1 . While the cellular functions of COPI and COPII as well as interdependence of the anterograde and retrograde trafficking routes are generally conserved across eukaryotes, the organization of the ER–Golgi interface varies greatly in different species. For example, plants and some yeast species have a compact organization of the ER and Golgi, whereas in animal cells the two organelles are separated by a pleomorphic intermediate compartment. The distribution of COPII budding sites on the ER, the nature of the transport vesicles themselves and the dependence on cytoskeletal components also vary. Furthermore, there seems to be enormous plasticity in the ER–Golgi interface, which can adapt to accommodate variations in COPII carrier size and number commensurate with cargo dimensions and quantity.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-nihpa.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1be7/4064004/3ec9ef7bc12d/nihms581152f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1be7/4064004/6c9eb54a90a1/nihms581152u1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1be7/4064004/fe449830361d/nihms581152u2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1be7/4064004/f4a50cbd9959/nihms581152f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1be7/4064004/3136b55047fd/nihms581152f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1be7/4064004/689e0813602b/nihms581152f4.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
IRE1: ER stress sensor and cell fate executor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3818365/,"Cells operate a signaling network termed unfolded protein response (UPR) to monitor protein-folding capacity in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). IRE1 is an ER transmembrane sensor that activates UPR to maintain ER and cellular function. While mammalian IRE1 promotes cell survive, it can initiate apoptosis via decay of anti-apoptotic microRNAs. Convergent and divergent IRE1 characteristics between plants and animals underscore its significance in cellular homeostasis. This review provides an updated scenario of IRE1 signaling model, discusses emerging IRE1 sensing mechanisms, compares IRE1 features among species, and outlines exciting future directions in UPR research.

Galactose-depleted xycoglucan is dysfunctional and leads to dwarfism in Arabidopsis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4378170/,"Xyloglucan is a polysaccharide that has important roles in the formation and function of the walls that surround growing land plant cells. Many of these plants synthesize xyloglucan that contains galactose in two different side chains (L and F), which exist in distinct molecular environments. However, little is known about the contribution of these side chains to xyloglucan function. Here, we show that Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) mutants devoid of the F side chain galactosyltransferase MURUS3 (MUR3) form xyloglucan that lacks F side chains and contains much less galactosylated xylose than its wild-type counterpart. The galactose-depleted xyloglucan is dysfunctional, as it leads to mutants that are dwarfed with curled rosette leaves, short petioles, and short inflorescence stems. Moreover, cell wall matrix polysaccharides, including xyloglucan and pectin, are not properly secreted and instead accumulate within intracellular aggregates. Near-normal growth is restored by generating mur3 mutants that produce no detectable amounts of xyloglucan. Thus, cellular processes are affected more by the presence of the dysfunctional xyloglucan than by eliminating xyloglucan altogether. To identify structural features responsible for xyloglucan dysfunction, xyloglucan structure was modified in situ by generating mur3 mutants that lack specific xyloglucan xylosyltransferases (XXTs) or that overexpress the XYLOGLUCAN L-SIDE CHAIN GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE2 ( XLT2 ) gene. Normal growth was restored in the mur3-3 mutant overexpressing XLT2 and in mur3-3 xxt double mutants when the dysfunctional xyloglucan was modified by doubling the amounts of galactosylated side chains. Our study assigns a role for galactosylation in normal xyloglucan function and demonstrates that altering xyloglucan side chain structure disturbs diverse cellular and physiological processes.
There have been considerable advances in understanding how changes in specific amino acids or nucleotides affect the ability of a protein or an RNA to fold and to function ( Wan et al., 2011 ; Sauer, 2013 ). By contrast, much less is known about how polysaccharide structure and function are affected by altering specific monosaccharides within its glycosyl sequence. Here, we report that xyloglucan, a plant cell wall polysaccharide, becomes dysfunctional rather than nonfunctional when its glycosyl sequence is altered. The term dysfunctional polysaccharide is used here to describe a structure that, in and of itself, has a deleterious effect on the growth and development of a plant.
XXXG-type xyloglucans ( XyG s; Fig. 1A ) are present in the cell walls of many flowering plants ( Hoffman et al., 2005 ), gymnosperms ( Hsieh and Harris, 2012 ), ferns and their allies, club and spike mosses, and the avascular hornworts ( Peña et al., 2008 ). XyG s of this type are composed of subunits ( Fig. 1, A and B ) that have three consecutive β- d -glucopyranose (β- d -Glc p ) backbone residues bearing a side chain followed by a single unbranched β- d -Glc p residue ( Tuomivaara et al., 2015 ). Little is known about the contribution of these side chains to the role of XyG in wall structure and function, although the results of in vitro studies suggest that they modulate how an XyG interacts with cellulose ( Whitney et al., 2006 ) and with itself ( Shirakawa et al., 1998 ; de Freitas et al., 2011 ).","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plntphys.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c2f8/4378170/d720b921793d/PP_255943_f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c2f8/4378170/9ec405911481/PP_255943_f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c2f8/4378170/65386e0909cc/PP_255943_f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c2f8/4378170/c1819cb8ce4f/PP_255943_f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c2f8/4378170/b2c04a17c6b0/PP_255943_f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c2f8/4378170/d5169d6dfde1/PP_255943_f6.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c2f8/4378170/cf1c6c622d6c/PP_255943_f7.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

Vesicles versus Tubes: Is Endoplasmic Reticulum-Golgi Transport in Plants Fundamentally Different from Other Eukaryotes?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4453782/,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the gateway to the secretory pathway in all eukaryotic cells. Its products subsequently pass through the Golgi apparatus on the way to the cell surface (true secretion) or to the lytic compartment of the cell (vacuolar protein transport). In animal cells, the Golgi apparatus is present as a stationary larger order complex near the nucleus, and transport between the cortical ER and the Golgi complex occurs via an intermediate compartment which is transported on microtubules. By contrast, higher plant cells have discrete mobile Golgi stacks that move along the cortical ER, and the intermediate compartment is absent. Although many of the major molecular players involved in ER-Golgi trafficking in mammalian and yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) cells have homologs in higher plants, the narrow interface (less than 500 nm) between the Golgi and the ER, together with the motility factor, makes the identification of the transport vectors responsible for bidirectional traffic between these two organelles much more difficult. Over the years, a controversy has arisen over the two major possibilities by which transfer can occur: through vesicles or direct tubular connections. In this article, four leading plant cell biologists attempted to resolve this issue. Unfortunately, their opinions are so divergent and often opposing that it was not possible to reach a consensus. Thus, we decided to let each tell his or her version individually. The review begins with an article by Federica Brandizzi that provides the necessary molecular background on coat protein complexes in relation to the so-called secretory units model for ER-Golgi transport in highly vacuolated plant cells. The second article, written by Chris Hawes, presents the evidence in favor of tubules. It is followed by an article from David Robinson defending the classical notion that transport occurs via vesicles. The last article, by Akihiko Nakano, introduces the reader to possible alternatives to vesicles or tubules, which are now emerging as a result of exciting new developments in high-resolution light microscopy in yeast.
Cell biology textbooks usually give a description of the Golgi apparatus as it is seen and functions in a mammalian cell. This is understandable considering the huge body of literature on this organelle in animal cells, especially in relation to disease. It also reflects and is designed to accommodate the large readership from the medical sciences. With few exceptions ( Ito et al., 2014 ), there are few reviews on the Golgi apparatus that give a balanced account of its structure and function across the whole eukaryotic kingdom.
The plant Golgi apparatus is nevertheless a fascinating organelle that has unique features, especially when compared with its mammalian counterpart. It is polydisperse rather than being present as a continuous perinuclear ribbon, it does not disassemble during mitosis, and it is motile. These characteristics are of great importance, especially because Golgi stacks in plants, along with their protein processing functions, have been termed polysaccharide factories and their activity is essential for formation of a cell wall during cytokinesis and growth. Nevertheless, it is Golgi stack motility that makes bidirectional protein transport between the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and the Golgi apparatus in plants conceptually more difficult to grasp and therefore even more intriguing than others in other eukaryotic kingdoms.
There is general consensus that in all eukaryotes, anterograde protein transport out of the ER is largely dependent upon Coat Protein II (COII) proteins and that retrograde transport both within the Golgi stack and between the Golgi and the ER requires COPI proteins ( Szul and Sztul, 2011 ; Barlowe and Miller, 2013 ). Because recruitment of proteins in yeasts and mammals culminates in the formation of a transport vesicle, it is logical to assume that this may also be the case for plants. However, whereas there appears to be no doubt about the formation and release of COPI vesicles at the periphery of plant Golgi cisternae ( Pimpl et al., 2000 ; Donohoe et al., 2007 ), the existence of COPII-coated vesicles and their operation as anterograde transport vectors in the narrow (less than 500 nm) interface between the ER and Golgi apparatus of land plants is a matter of considerable controversy ( Hawes et al., 2008 ; Hawes, 2012 ). By contrast, there are numerous examples among lower eukaryotes where electron micrographs reveal a Golgi stack immediately adjacent (less than 500 nm) to transitional ER , per definition, a domain of the ER (or nuclear envelope) showing vesicle budding profiles and lacking ribosomes. The best examples for this are probably the yeast Pichia pastoris ( Mogelsvang et al., 2003 ) and the algae Chlamydomonas noctigama ( Fig. 1, A and B ; Hummel et al., 2007 ), Tribonema vulgare , and Melosira varians (see Getty Images nos. 169272449 and 128618249; www.gettyimages.com ). ER vesiculation profiles have often been recorded for mammalian cells going right back to the early papers of George Palade (for references, see Tartakoff, 2002 ). Interestingly, in all of these cases, as with the algae just mentioned, classical chemical fixation was sufficient to obtain the images.

Pectin methylesterification impacts the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4902601/,"Photosynthesis occurs in mesophyll cells of specialized organs such as leaves. The rigid cell wall encapsulating photosynthetic cells controls the expansion and distribution of cells within photosynthetic tissues. The relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth is affected by leaf area. However, the underlying genetic mechanisms affecting carbon partitioning to different aspects of leaf growth are not known. To fill this gap, we analyzed Arabidopsis plants with altered levels of pectin methylesterification, which is known to modulate cell wall plasticity and plant growth. Pectin methylesterification levels were varied through manipulation of cotton Golgi-related ( CGR ) 2 or 3 genes encoding two functionally redundant pectin methyltransferases. Increased levels of methylesterification in a line over-expressing CGR2 (CGR2OX) resulted in highly expanded leaves with enhanced intercellular air spaces; reduced methylesterification in a mutant lacking both CGR -genes 2 and 3 (cgr2/3) resulted in thin but dense leaf mesophyll that limited CO 2 diffusion to chloroplasts. Leaf, root, and plant dry weight were enhanced in CGR2OX but decreased in cgr2/3. Differences in growth between wild type and the CGR -mutants can be explained by carbon partitioning but not by variations in area-based photosynthesis. Therefore, photosynthesis drives growth through alterations in carbon partitioning to new leaf area growth and leaf mass per unit leaf area; however, CGR -mediated pectin methylesterification acts as a primary factor in this relationship through modulation of the expansion and positioning of the cells in leaves, which in turn drive carbon partitioning by generating dynamic carbon demands in leaf area growth and leaf mass per unit leaf area.
Photosynthesis is the major source of carbon (C) for plant growth. However, there is no clear correlation between area-based photosynthesis and plant growth, and studies have shown that the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth is affected by leaf area growth parameters. A strong positive correlation exists between relative growth rate and leaf growth parameters such as leaf area per unit leaf mass (specific leaf area, SLA ), leaf area per unit plant mass (leaf area ratio), and investment of C in leaf growth (leaf mass ratio; Shipley, 2002 ; Lambers et al., 2008 ; Poorter et al., 2009 ). In fact, modeled partitioning coefficients obtained from the Arabidopsis leaf area growth model showed that plant growth is more sensitive to changes in C partitioning to leaf thickening and leaf area growth than to changes to area-based photosynthesis ( Weraduwage et al., 2015 ). The term “thickening” was used to indicate increased mass per unit leaf area ( LMA ), whether that results from increased thickness in the normal sense of more depth to the leaf between adaxial and abaxial surfaces or from increased cell density. LMA is the reciprocal of SLA . While LMA has been shown to positively and linearly correlate with investment to leaves in the form of anatomical and chemical composition changes, SLA shows a hyperbolic relationship with such changes ( Poorter et al., 2009 ). Therefore, we will mainly focus on LMA throughout this work. Weraduwage et al. (2015) concluded that even though photosynthetic C is required for growth, the degree of growth is determined by the amount of C partitioned to leaf area growth and LMA ( Weraduwage et al., 2015 ). However, how and to what degree this variation in leaf expansion and LMA is affected by cell wall properties of leaf mesophyll cells is not known. In addition, the underlying mechanisms that drive C partitioning to favor either leaf area growth or LMA , and the genes that can influence changes in C demands toward these two processes, are yet to be found.
Leaves are the major photosynthetic organs in plants and regulation of cell expansion and growth is crucial for the development of leaf architecture. Leaf growth can occur in the form of leaf area or LMA ( Lambers et al., 2008 ; Weraduwage et al., 2015 ). The size and shape of cells in the leaf mesophyll can have a significant impact on: (1) projected or effective leaf surface area, which is the leaf area capable of intercepting light; (2) leaf mass per unit leaf area or LMA ; (3) CO 2 conductance from the external environment through intercellular air spaces into chloroplasts in mesophyll cells; and (4) surface area of mesophyll cells and chloroplasts exposed to intercellular airspaces ( Honda and Fisher, 1978 ; Evans et al., 1994 ; Galmés et al., 2013 ). The plant cell wall controls expansion and positioning of cells of photosynthetic tissues and therefore, changes in cell wall properties will have a direct impact on the above properties. Although there is evidence for changes in leaf architecture as a result of alterations in genes that affect the synthesis and properties of the cell wall ( Burton et al., 2000 ; Kim and Delaney, 2002 ; Pilling et al., 2004 ; Wolf et al., 2009 ; Kim et al., 2015 ), an in-depth analysis of effects on leaf gas exchange and overall plant growth under such circumstances has not yet been conducted.
The plant cell wall is composed mainly of polysaccharides, and among these, pectin is considered a critical element that controls cell wall elasticity and expansion. Pectin is synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and secreted in a highly methylesterified form. Methylesterification of galacturonic acid (GalUA) is catalyzed by pectin methyltransferases ( Wolf et al., 2009 ; Kim et al., 2015 ). The level of pectin methylesterification in the cell wall is controlled by methylesterases and inhibitors of methylesterases, which modify the levels of methylation and demethylation of GalUA in the pectin backbone ( Wolf et al., 2009 ; Kim et al., 2015 ). Removal of methyl groups by methylesterases allows carboxyl groups of GalUA to form Ca 2+ - and Mg 2+ -mediated intermolecular linkages that lead to hardening of pectin ( Burton et al., 2000 ; Heldt and Piechulla, 2010 ; Kim et al., 2015 ). Indeed, over-expression of pectin methylesterase inhibitors results in longer root cells ( Lionetti et al., 2007 ). Therefore, the degree of methylation and demethylation of pectin determines the delicate balance between cell wall extensibility and rigidity with consequent effects on growth and shape of cells ( Burton et al., 2000 ; Pilling et al., 2004 ; Lionetti et al., 2007 ; Wolf et al., 2009 ; Xiao and Anderson, 2013 ; Kim et al., 2015 ). Consistent with this notion, over-expression of pectin methyltransferases, CGR2 or CGR3 , led to enhanced rosette size and fresh weight in Arabidopsis ( Kim et al., 2015 ). However, a double knockout of CGR2 and CGR3 genes, named cgr2/3 , showed reduced cell expansion and overall plant growth; both phenotypes correlated with reduced levels of pectin methylesterification compared to wild type ( Kim et al., 2015 ). To our knowledge, the effect of pectin methylation on leaf growth parameters, photosynthesis, and respiration through its effect on leaf architecture has not been studied.
The goal of this study was to use the Arabidopsis model system developed by Kim et al. (2015) with altered levels of pectin methyltransferases, CGR2 or CGR3 (single gene modifiers found to positively or negatively affect cell expansion as a function of their cellular availability) to investigate how changes in cell-wall plasticity affect C assimilation, leaf respiration, and overall plant growth through effects on leaf area growth and mesophyll structure. We examined whether the changes in overall plant growth in Arabidopsis with altered CGR2 and CGR3 could result from changes in leaf area growth and LMA or changes in area-based photosynthesis to explore the relationship between photosynthesis and growth. Based on the differences in rosette size reported previously ( Kim et al., 2015 ), we hypothesized that area-based photosynthesis rates would be lower in a CGR2 over-expressor (CGR2OX) but larger in the mutant lacking both CGR2 and 3 genes ( cgr2/3 ). As CGR2 and CGR3 affect pectin methylation and cell expansion in leaves, we also hypothesized that plant growth would be enhanced in the CGR2OX line and reduced in the cgr2/3 mutant mainly as a result of altered LMA . Indeed, through analysis of leaf and plant growth, gas exchange, and growth modeling, we found that CGR 2 and CGR 3 have significant impacts on photosynthesis and respiration through alteration of mesophyll structure and LMA . Plant growth was enhanced in the CGR2OX line but reduced in the cgr2/3 mutant. This variation in plant growth was as a result of differences in C partitioning and not as a result of changes in photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area. These observations support a novel (to our knowledge) model that changes in cell wall plasticity due to changes in pectin composition influence C partitioning between leaf area growth and LMA , thereby regulating the relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plntphys.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/dd60/4902601/bffc9bdaaf06/PP_PP201600173R1_f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/dd60/4902601/12b96ef18566/PP_PP201600173R1_f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/dd60/4902601/bb56d56b0a13/PP_PP201600173R1_f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/dd60/4902601/682876137f32/PP_PP201600173R1_f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/dd60/4902601/87bbb4f2dbc2/PP_PP201600173R1_f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/dd60/4902601/0c03baddaf33/PP_PP201600173R1_f6.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/dd60/4902601/83a2fedb891a/PP_PP201600173R1_f7.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/dd60/4902601/f0164b437707/PP_PP201600173R1_f8.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/dd60/4902601/08b9d436e09b/PP_PP201600173R1_f9.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/dd60/4902601/47ca291e0877/PP_PP201600173R1_f10.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/dd60/4902601/f23bfc162522/PP_PP201600173R1_f11.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/dd60/4902601/5fce116fb08b/PP_PP201600173R1_f12.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Reduced Chloroplast Coverage genes from Arabidopsis thaliana help to establish the size of the chloroplast compartment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4776492/,"Eukaryotic cells require mechanisms to establish the proportion of cellular volume devoted to particular organelles. These mechanisms are poorly understood. From a screen for plastid-to-nucleus signaling mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana , we cloned a mutant allele of a gene that encodes a protein of unknown function that is homologous to two other Arabidopsis genes of unknown function and to FRIENDLY , which was previously shown to promote the normal distribution of mitochondria in Arabidopsis . In contrast to FRIENDLY , these three homologs of FRIENDLY are found only in photosynthetic organisms. Based on these data, we proposed that FRIENDLY expanded into a small gene family to help regulate the energy metabolism of cells that contain both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Indeed, we found that knocking out these genes caused a number of chloroplast phenotypes, including a reduction in the proportion of cellular volume devoted to chloroplasts to 50% of wild type. Thus, we refer to these genes as REDUCED CHLOROPLAST COVERAGE ( REC ). The size of the chloroplast compartment was reduced most in rec1 mutants. The REC1 protein accumulated in the cytosol and the nucleus. REC1 was excluded from the nucleus when plants were treated with amitrole, which inhibits cell expansion and chloroplast function. We conclude that REC1 is an extraplastidic protein that helps to establish the size of the chloroplast compartment, and that signals derived from cell expansion or chloroplasts may regulate REC1.
Chloroplasts drive plant growth, development, and reproduction by converting solar energy into biologically useful forms of energy. Thus, the biogenesis and function of chloroplasts underpin crop yields and, indeed, life on Earth. Chloroplasts develop from proplastids during germination and leaf development ( 1 ). After chloroplast biogenesis, chloroplasts divide by binary fission. A number of mutant alleles enhance or reduce the size of individual chloroplasts by attenuating or promoting chloroplast division ( 2 ). Regardless of the size of individual chloroplasts, the proportion of cellular volume devoted to all chloroplasts appears indistinguishable from wild type in these mutants ( 3 – 5 ). Thus, the mechanism that establishes the size of the chloroplast compartment appears distinct from the mechanisms of chloroplast division.
The cell expansion that drives the expansion of leaves also drives the proliferation of chloroplasts. Indeed, the proliferation of chloroplasts is so tightly correlated with cell expansion that the ratio of the size of the chloroplast compartment to the size of mesophyll cells is constant, regardless of cell size ( 2 , 6 , 7 ). Cell type exerts a major influence over the proportion of cellular volume devoted to the chloroplast. For instance, the size of the chloroplast compartment in mesophyll cells is larger than in epidermal cells. Thus, an extraplastidic mechanism appears to determine the size of the chloroplast compartment ( 6 ). However, during the expansion of leaves, chloroplasts are not completely submissive to the cell. Indeed, chloroplast dysfunction inhibits the expansion of leaves ( 8 ).
Although mechanisms that establish the proportion of cellular volume devoted to particular organelles are of fundamental importance to biology, these mechanisms remain poorly understood ( 2 ). In the particular case of chloroplasts, understanding these mechanisms may lead to significant advances for agriculture. For example, introducing C 4 photosynthesis into rice, a plant that performs C 3 photosynthesis, is one strategy for potentially increasing yields from this important crop ( 9 ). C 3 and C 4 leaves are distinct at the metabolic, cellular, and anatomical levels ( 9 , 10 ). One of the conserved features of C 4 leaves is the increase and decrease in the size of the chloroplast compartment in bundle sheath and mesophyll cells, respectively, relative to C 3 leaves ( 10 ). The engineering of C 4 photosynthesis in important C 3 crops, such as rice, is thought to depend on the ability to rationally manipulate the size of the chloroplast compartment ( 11 ).
We performed a screen for plastid-to-nucleus signaling mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana ( 12 ). From this screen, we obtained one mutant allele of a gene that encodes a protein of unknown function. This gene is homologous to two Arabidopsis genes that encode proteins of unknown function and to FRIENDLY . FRIENDLY and its orthologs promote the normal distribution of mitochondria in Arabidopsis and in nonphotosynthetic organisms ( 13 ). However, these three Arabidopsis homologs of FRIENDLY are found only in photosynthetic organisms. Based on these data, we thought that FRIENDLY may have expanded into a small gene family to help manage the energy metabolism of cells that contain both chloroplasts and mitochondria. We tested this idea by examining the phenotypes of mutants in which one, two, three, or all four of these genes are knocked out. We found that these mutants exhibited a number of chloroplast phenotypes, including a smaller chloroplast compartment relative to wild type. Thus, we named these genes REDUCED CHLOROPLAST COVERAGE ( REC ). We also found that the protein that contributes most to establishing the size of the chloroplast compartment, REC1, localizes to both the nucleus and the cytosol, and we provide evidence that signals derived from dysfunctional chloroplasts or the inhibition of cell expansion may regulate the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of REC1.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-pnas.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/894f/4776492/ab89876c1779/pnas.1515741113fig01.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/894f/4776492/dd47e28ff99a/pnas.1515741113fig02.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/894f/4776492/1a5ffb0efa97/pnas.1515741113fig03.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/894f/4776492/1669e9484586/pnas.1515741113fig04.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/894f/4776492/f678c36779b1/pnas.1515741113fig05.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/894f/4776492/fe0d64b8c6d7/pnas.1515741113fig06.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/894f/4776492/0eb7c270894d/pnas.1515741113fig07.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

NADPH oxidase activity is required for ER stress survival in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6289879/,"In all eukaryotes, the unfolded protein response (UPR) relieves endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is a potentially lethal condition caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. In mammalian and yeast cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during ER stress attenuate the UPR, negatively impacting cell survival. In plants, the relationship between the UPR and ROS is less clear. Although ROS develop during ER stress, the sources of ROS linked to ER stress responses and the physiological impact of ROS generation on the survival from proteotoxic stress are yet unknown. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana the respiratory burst oxidase homologs, RBOHD and RBOHF, contribute to the production of ROS during ER stress. We also demonstrate that during ER stress RBOHD and RBOHF are necessary to properly mount the adaptive UPR and overcome temporary and chronic ER stress situations. These results ascribe a cytoprotective role to RBOH-generated ROS in the defense from proteotoxic stress in an essential organelle, and support a plant-specific feature of the UPR management among eukaryotes.

Relevance of the Unfolded Protein Response to Spaceflight-Induced Transcriptional Reprogramming in Arabidopsis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7987364/,"Plants are primary producers of food and oxygen on Earth and will likewise be indispensable to the establishment of large-scale sustainable ecosystems and human survival in space. To contribute to the understanding of how plants respond to spaceflight stress, we examined the significance of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental stresses, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana . To do so, we performed a large-scale comparative transcriptome profiling in wild type and various UPR-defective mutants during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission to the International Space Station. We established that orbital culture substantially alters the expression of hundreds of stress-related genes compared with ground control conditions. Although expression of those genes varied in the UPR mutants on the ground, it was largely similar across the genotypes in the spaceflight condition. Our results have yielded new information on how plants respond to growth in orbit and support the hypothesis that spaceflight induces the activation of signaling pathways that compensate for the loss of UPR regulators in the control of downstream transcriptional regulatory networks.

Reanalysis of the Mars500 experiment reveals common gut microbiome alterations in astronauts induced by long-duration confinement,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8099722/,"Maintaining astronaut health throughout long-duration spaceflight is essential to the feasibility of a manned mission to Mars. The ground-based Mars500 experiment investigated long-duration health by isolating six astronauts for 520 days, the longest controlled human confinement study conducted to date. After 520 days, astronauts had uniform strength and lean body mass losses, and increased fasting plasma glucose, calprotectin, and neutrophil levels characteristic of intestinal inflammation but previous analyses revealed no common significant changes in gut microbiota. This study reanalysed data from early (days 7–45) and late (days 420–520) faecal samples and identified 408 exact sequence variants (ESVs), including 213 shared by all astronauts. Thirty-two ESVs were significantly differentially abundant over time, including depletion of keystone resistant starch degrading, anti-inflammatory and insulin sensitivity-associated species, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii , Ruminococcus bromii , Blautia luti , Anaerostipes hadrus , Roseburia faecis , and Lactobacillus rogosae , and enrichment of yet-to-be-cultured bacteria. Additionally, the extraordinary experimental confinement allowed observation of microbiota potentially shared between astronauts and their habitat. Forty-nine species were shared, representing 49% and 12% of the human and environmental microbiome diversity, respectively. These findings reveal the microbiota which significantly altered in relative abundance throughout confinement, including species known to influence inflammation and host glucose homeostasis consistent with astronaut symptoms. Identification of microbiome alterations after 520 days of isolation represents a missing piece connecting Mars500 astronaut physiological studies. Knowledge of the impact of long-term confinement upon the human microbiome helps to improve our understanding of how humans interact with their habitats and is a valuable step forward towards enabling long-duration spaceflight.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-csbj.gif"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b43c/8099722/8d9da1980d3c/ga1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b43c/8099722/c20fd5155741/gr2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b43c/8099722/0fe4054bbb38/gr1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b43c/8099722/7a93c40c1cc5/gr3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b43c/8099722/be4543fac798/gr4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b43c/8099722/de8bbd3f91e4/gr5a.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b43c/8099722/ee0ee2f485b7/gr5b.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

Genomic stability in response to high versus low linear energy transfer radiation in Arabidopsis thaliana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4033213/,"Low linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays and high LET HZE (high atomic weight, high energy) particles act as powerful mutagens in both plants and animals. DNA damage generated by HZE particles is more densely clustered than that generated by gamma rays. To understand the genetic requirements for resistance to high versus low LET radiation, a series of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants were exposed to either 1GeV Fe nuclei or gamma radiation. A comparison of effects on the germination and subsequent growth of seedlings led us to conclude that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the two types of radiation (HZE versus gamma) are roughly 3:1. Similarly, in wild-type lines, loss of somatic heterozygosity was induced at an RBE of about a 2:1 (HZE versus gamma). Checkpoint and repair defects, as expected, enhanced sensitivity to both agents. The “replication fork” checkpoint, governed by ATR, played a slightly more important role in resistance to HZE-induced mutagenesis than in resistance to gamma induced mutagenesis.

Spaceflight increases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak and this cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11271499/,"Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca 2+ dysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca 2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-flown mice, the Ca 2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III) meso -tetrakis( N -n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca 2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In conclusion, we find that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca 2+ leak that cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment. Future work should investigate alternative therapeutics that are specifically aimed at increasing SERCA activation or reducing Ca 2+ leak.
Subject terms: Calcium channels, Physiology
Exposure to microgravity, and subsequent muscle unloading, is known to cause extensive muscle weakness and atrophy, especially to postural muscles such as the soleus 1 – 6 . Recent work has demonstrated that muscle weakness precedes muscle atrophy 4 and was thought to be due, at least in part, to Ca 2+ dysregulation 7 . Using soleus muscle samples from the rodent research (RR) -1 and -9 missions, we demonstrated the Ca 2+ uptake ability of the sarco (endo)plasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump to be severely impaired following ~1 month of spaceflight 5 . In muscle, SERCA is responsible for maintaining low intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations ([Ca 2+ ] i ) by bringing Ca 2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) 8 , 9 . Impaired SERCA function can result in high [Ca 2+ ] i , leading to elevated RONS, increased protein degradation, cell death, and muscle weakness and atrophy 10 – 14 . Structurally, SERCA pumps are highly susceptible to post-translational modifications (e.g., tyrosine nitration, cysteine nitrosylation) from elevated RONS that will impair its catalytic activity 5 , 15 – 22 . The ensuing elevated [Ca 2+ ] i will not only lead to muscle damage but can also further increase RONS production 23 – 25 creating a negative cyclic relationship that perpetuates muscle pathology.
While damaging at high concentrations, RONS are important signaling molecules at low concentrations 26 . Superoxide dismutases (SOD) are a family of enzymes that maintain physiological RONS concentrations by scavenging and neutralizing highly reactive superoxide molecules (for review, see ref. 27 ). Mice deficient of SOD show impaired SERCA activity, muscle weakness, and atrophy 11 , 20 , 22 ; but, the pharmacological activation of SERCA can reduce mitochondrial RONS production and attenuate muscle atrophy despite increased oxidative stress 11 , 12 . Thus, targeting SERCA, either through genetic overexpression or pharmacological intervention, may be a viable target to attenuate muscle atrophy and weakness. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with Manganese(III) meso -tetrakis( N -n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE, also seen as BMX-001), an antioxidant that acts as a SOD mimetic 28 , 29 , could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction in the murine soleus muscle following 35 days of spaceflight. BuOE has been effective in reducing oxidative stress in various animal models of radiation-induced injury 30 – 33 , a relevant injury mechanism to spaceflight, providing strong rationale for the investigation of its effectiveness in the present study.
Following 35 days of exposure to microgravity, absolute soleus weight was significantly reduced in the flight groups compared to GC/VIV groups ( p = 0.0005) with no effect of BuOE treatment (Fig. 1A ). No effects of flight or treatment were observed on body weight (Fig. 1B ) resulting in a main effect of flight reducing the soleus:body weight ratio ( p = 0.0053, Fig. 1C ).","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-npjmicrogr.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6419/11271499/1f042e6ff875/41526_2024_419_Fig1_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6419/11271499/765e7dc83e96/41526_2024_419_Fig2_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6419/11271499/7de36f626bd7/41526_2024_419_Fig3_HTML.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Cardiovascular progenitor cells cultured aboard the International Space Station exhibit altered developmental and functional properties,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6062551/,"The heart and its cellular components are profoundly altered by missions to space and injury on Earth. Further research, however, is needed to characterize and address the molecular substrates of such changes. For this reason, neonatal and adult human cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) were cultured aboard the International Space Station. Upon return to Earth, we measured changes in the expression of microRNAs and of genes related to mechanotransduction, cardiogenesis, cell cycling, DNA repair, and paracrine signaling. We additionally assessed endothelial-like tube formation, cell cycling, and migratory capacity of CPCs. Changes in microRNA expression were predicted to target extracellular matrix interactions and Hippo signaling in both neonatal and adult CPCs. Genes related to mechanotransduction ( YAP1, RHOA ) were downregulated, while the expression of cytoskeletal genes ( VIM , NES , DES , LMNB2 , LMNA ), non-canonical Wnt ligands ( WNT5A , WNT9A ), and Wnt/calcium signaling molecules ( PLCG1 , PRKCA ) was significantly elevated in neonatal CPCs. Increased mesendodermal gene expression along with decreased expression of mesodermal derivative markers ( TNNT2 , VWF , and RUNX2 ), reduced readiness to form endothelial-like tubes, and elevated expression of Bmp and Tbx genes, were observed in neonatal CPCs. Both neonatal and adult CPCs exhibited increased expression of DNA repair genes and paracrine factors, which was supported by enhanced migration. While spaceflight affects cytoskeletal organization and migration in neonatal and adult CPCs, only neonatal CPCs experienced increased expression of early developmental markers and an enhanced proliferative potential. Efforts to recapitulate the effects of spaceflight on Earth by regulating processes described herein may be a promising avenue for cardiac repair.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-npjmicrogr.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/af84/6062551/c5a226b2d5f9/41526_2018_48_Fig1_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/af84/6062551/1b6a69284dbd/41526_2018_48_Fig2_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/af84/6062551/1baa54c1d043/41526_2018_48_Fig3_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/af84/6062551/db47320593c0/41526_2018_48_Fig4_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/af84/6062551/f35e5fae738c/41526_2018_48_Fig5_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/af84/6062551/4518363104b1/41526_2018_48_Fig6_HTML.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Inter-agency perspective: Translating advances in biomarker discovery and medical countermeasures development between terrestrial and space radiation environments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9832585/,"Over the past 20+ years, the U.S. Government has made significant strides in establishing research funding and initiating a portfolio consisting of subject matter experts on radiation-induced biological effects in normal tissues. Research supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) provided much of the early findings on identifying cellular pathways involved in radiation injuries, due to the need to push the boundaries to kill tumor cells while minimizing damage to intervening normal tissues. By protecting normal tissue surrounding the tumors, physicians can deliver a higher radiation dose to tumors and reduce adverse effects related to the treatment. Initially relying on this critical NCI research, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), first tasked with developing radiation medical countermeasures in 2004, has provided bridge funding to move basic research toward advanced development and translation. The goal of the NIAID program is to fund approaches that can one day be employed to protect civilian populations during a radiological or nuclear incident. In addition, with the reality of long-term space flights and the possibility of radiation exposures to both acute, high-intensity, and chronic lower-dose levels, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has identified requirements to discover and develop radioprotectors and mitigators to protect their astronauts during space missions. In sustained partnership with sister agencies, these three organizations must continue to leverage funding and findings in their overlapping research areas to accelerate biomarker identification and product development to help safeguard these different and yet undeniably similar human populations – cancer patients, public citizens, and astronauts.

Genomic and functional characterization of Enterococcus faecalis isolates recovered from the International Space Station and their potential for pathogenicity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7829349/,"Enterococcus faecalis is a multidrug resistant, opportunistic human pathogen and a leading cause of hospital acquired infections. Recently, isolates have been recovered from the air and surfaces onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Pangenomic and functional analyses were carried out to assess their potential impact on astronaut health. Genomes of each ISS isolate, and both clinical and commensal reference strains, were evaluated for their core and unique gene content, acquired antibiotic resistance genes, phage, plasmid content, and virulence traits. In order to determine their potential survival when outside of the human host, isolates were also challenged with three weeks of desiccation at 30% relative humidity. Finally, pathogenicity of the ISS strains was evaluated in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. At the culmination of this study, there were no defining signatures that separated known pathogenic strains from the more commensal phenotypes using the currently available resources. As a result, the current reliance on database information alone must be shifted to experimentally evaluated genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of clinically relevant microorganisms.

Evaluation of in vitro macrophage differentiation during space flight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570223/,"We differentiated mouse bone marrow cells in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony stimulating (rM-CSF) factor for 14 days during the flight of space shuttle Space Transportation System (STS)-126. We tested the hypothesis that the receptor expression for M-CSF, c-Fms was reduced. We used flow cytometry to assess molecules on cells that were preserved during flight to define the differentiation state of the developing bone marrow macrophages; including CD11b, CD31, CD44, Ly6C, Ly6G, F4/80, Mac2, c-Fos as well as c-Fms. In addition, RNA was preserved during the flight and was used to perform a gene microarray. We found that there were significant differences in the number of macrophages that developed in space compared to controls maintained on Earth. We found that there were significant changes in the distribution of cells that expressed CD11b, CD31, F4/80, Mac2, Ly6C and c-Fos. However, there were no changes in c-Fms expression and no consistent pattern of advanced or retarded differentiation during space flight. We also found a pattern of transcript levels that would be consistent with a relatively normal differentiation outcome but increased proliferation by the bone marrow macrophages that were assayed after 14 days of space flight. There also was a surprising pattern of space flight influence on genes of the coagulation pathway. These data confirm that a space flight can have an impact on the in vitro development of macrophages from mouse bone marrow cells.

Identification of critical host mitochondrion-associated genes during Ehrlichia chaffeensis infections,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3457586/,"Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME). To determine what host components are important for bacterial replication, we performed microarray analysis on Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells by comparing host gene transcript levels between permissive and nonpermissive conditions for E. chaffeensis growth. Five-hundred twenty-seven genes had increased transcript levels unique to permissive growth conditions 24 h postinfection. We screened adult flies that were mutants for several of the “permissive” genes for the ability to support Ehrlichia replication. Three additional D. melanogaster fly lines with putative mutations in pyrimidine metabolism were also tested. Ten fly lines carrying mutations in the genes CG6479 , separation anxiety , chitinase 11 , CG6364 ( Uck2 ), CG6543 ( Echs1 ), withered ( whd ), CG15881 ( Ccdc58 ), CG14806 ( Apop1 ), CG11875 ( Nup37 ), and dumpy ( dp ) had increased resistance to infection with Ehrlichia . Analysis of RNA by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed that the bacterial load was decreased in these mutant flies compared to wild-type infected control flies. Seven of these genes ( san , Cht11 , Uck2 , Echs1 , whd , C cdc58 , and Apop1 ) encoded proteins that had mitochondrial functions or could be associated with proteins with mitochondrial functions. Treatment of THP-1 cells with double-stranded RNA to silence the human UCK2 gene indicates that the disruption of the uridine-cytidine kinase affects E. chaffeensis replication in human macrophages. Experiments with cyclopentenyl cytosine (CPEC), a CTP synthetase inhibitor and cytosine, suggest that the nucleotide salvage pathway is essential for E. chaffeensis replication and that it may be important for the provision of CTP, uridine, and cytidine nucleotides.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-iai.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ef7a/3457586/82ee277288f4/zii9990998340001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ef7a/3457586/b2a3d9142a4f/zii9990998340002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ef7a/3457586/586002c93018/zii9990998340003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ef7a/3457586/44b529c5d868/zii9990998340004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ef7a/3457586/d8883f25a401/zii9990998340005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ef7a/3457586/9500668d19db/zii9990998340006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ef7a/3457586/f2ef2def37fc/zii9990998340007.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ef7a/3457586/436aa9c10c0b/zii9990998340008.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ef7a/3457586/dc244281b694/zii9990998340009.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Ehrlichia chaffeensis replication sites in adult Drosophila melanogaster.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3558598/,"Ehrlichia chaffeensis is a Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium which causes the tick-borne disease human monocytic ehrlichiosis. In vertebrates, E. chaffeensis replicates in monocytes and macrophages. However, no clear cell or tissue tropism has been defined in arthropods. Our group identified two host genes that control E. chaffeensis replication and infection in vivo in Drosophila , Uridine cytidine kinase and separation anxiety . Using the UAS-GAL4 RNAi system, we generated F1 flies ( UAS-gene of interest RNAi x tissue-GAL4 flies) that have Uck2 or san silenced in ubiquitous or tissue-specific fashion. When Uck2 or san were suppressed in the hemocytes or in the fat body, E. chaffeensis replicated poorly and caused significantly less severe infections.

Understanding macrophage differentiation during space flight: The importance of ground-based experiments before space flight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3890248/,"In preparation for a space flight on STS-126, two in vitro culture systems were used to investigate macrophage colony stimulating factor-dependent macrophage differentiation from mouse primary bone marrow cells. The patented Techshot Cell Cult Bioreactor and the BioServe Fluid Processing Apparatus (FPA) 1 were operated in different orientations to determine their impact on macrophage growth and differentiation. Bone marrow cell parameters were determined after cells were grown in FPAs incubated at 37°C in vertical or horizontal orientations, and macrophage cell recovery was significantly higher from FPAs that were incubated in the horizontal orientation compared to “vertical” FPAs. Similarly, when bone marrow cells were grown in the Techshot bioreactor, there were significant differences in the numbers of macrophages recovered after 7 days, depending on movement and orientation of the bioreactor. Macrophage recovery was highest when the patented bioreactor was rotated in the horizontal, x-axis plane (merry-go-round fashion) compared to static and vertically, y-axis plane rotated (Ferris wheel fashion) bioreactors. In addition, the expression of F4/80 and other differentiation markers varied depending on whether macrophages differentiated in FPAs or in bioreactors. After 7 days, significant differences in size, granularity and molecule expression were seen even when the same primary bone marrow cells were used to seed the cultures. These data show that culture outcomes are highly dependent on the culture device and device orientation. Moreover, the impact of the culture system needs to be understood in order to interpret space flight data.

Bone marrow leptin signaling mediates obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation in male mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3868799/,"Obesity is characterized by an increased recruitment of proinflammatory macrophages to the adipose tissue (AT), leading to systemic inflammation and metabolic disease. The pathogenesis of this AT inflammation, however, remains to be elucidated. The circulating adipokine leptin is increased in obesity and is involved in immune cell function and activation. In the present study, we investigated the role of leptin in the induction of obesity-associated inflammation. We generated radiation chimeric C57BL/6J mice reconstituted with either leptin receptor-deficient ( db / db ) or wild-type (WT) bone marrow and challenged them with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Mice reconstituted with db / db bone marrow (WT/db), had significantly lower body weight and adiposity compared with mice with WT bone marrow (WT/WT). Gonadal AT in WT/db mice displayed a 2-fold lower expression of the inflammatory genes Tnfa , Il6 , and Ccl2 . In addition, gonadal fat of WT/db mice contained significantly fewer crown-like structures compared with WT/WT mice, and most of their AT macrophages expressed macrophage galactose-type C type lectin 1 (MGL1) and were C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2)-negative, indicative of an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Moreover, WT/db mice exhibited greater insulin sensitivity compared with WT/WT mice. These data show that disrupted leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells attenuates the proinflammatory conditions that mediate many of the metabolic complications that characterize obesity. Our findings establish a novel mechanism involved in the regulation of obesity-associated systemic inflammation and support the hypothesis that leptin is a proinflammatory cytokine.
Obesity is positively correlated with a plethora of inflammatory diseases and a higher susceptibility to infections ( 1 ). Therefore, investigating the link between obesity and immune system function is of utmost importance.
The close interplay between metabolic and inflammatory pathways is beneficial under physiological conditions but becomes deleterious with either nutrient scarcity or nutrient excess ( 2 ). Indeed, obesity is characterized by a state of low-grade inflammation ( 3 ) in which increased levels of inflammatory markers and leptin prevail in the expanding adipose tissue (AT) ( 4 , 5 ). This chronic low-grade inflammation is believed to be the origin of most the obesity-associated diseases ( 2 ).
Macrophages have been identified as the major secretory cells in AT, contributing to systemic and local inflammation in obesity ( 6 , 7 ). AT macrophage (ATM) recruitment is increased dramatically with the expansion of fat mass, comprising up to 50% of AT cells in the obese state ( 6 ). In addition to being more numerous in obese subjects, ATMs differ in localization, phenotype, and function between lean and obese individuals. In the lean state, resident (type II) macrophages display an anti-inflammatory phenotype with high gene expression of Il10 , Mgl1 (macrophage galactose-type-C-type lectin 1), and Arg1 ( 8 ). Type II macrophages are mouse EGF-like module containing mucin-like hormone receptor-like 1 positive (F4/80 + ), cluster of differentiation molecule 11c negative (CD11c − ), MGL1 + (CD301) ( 9 ), and dispersed in the interstitial space between adipocytes ( 10 ) where they are believed to play a role in preserving AT integrity and maintenance. Conversely, obesity-recruited (type I) macrophages display a proinflammatory phenotype ( 9 ), have a high level of expression of Tnfa , Il6 and Nos2 ( 11 ) transcripts, and are F4/80 + , CD11c + , and MGL1 − ( 8 , 12 ). These cells form what is known as crown-like structures (CLSs) surrounding adipocytes and are involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance ( 13 ).
Although macrophage involvement in AT inflammation with obesity is well characterized, little is known about the mechanistic basis for ATM accumulation. Leptin is involved in both innate and adaptive immunity ( 14 ). The long leptin receptor isoform (LepRb), responsible for leptin's physiological activities ( 15 ), has been identified on most immune cells including monocytes and macrophages ( 16 – 19 ). Leptin-deficient ( ob / ob ) and leptin receptor-deficient ( db / db ) mice exhibit less macrophage infiltration and inflammatory gene expression in AT, despite increased weight gain and adiposity ( 7 ). Moreover, obesity is accompanied by sustained elevated circulating concentrations of leptin, resulting in leptin resistance ( 20 ).
In the present study, we investigated whether leptin signaling in white blood cells was involved in the recruitment of proinflammatory ATMs in diet-induced obesity. We demonstrated that the absence of leptin-receptor signaling in white blood cells led to reduced weight gain and adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed db / db bone marrow-transplanted wild-type (WT) mice compared with HFD-fed mice that received WT bone marrow transplants. Mice that received db / db bone marrow also exhibited decreased AT inflammation.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-endo.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4755/3868799/21667e6d4eac/zee9991373060001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4755/3868799/e64bc0c325bb/zee9991373060002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4755/3868799/606686daaf57/zee9991373060003.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Establishment and characterization of DB-1: a leptin receptor-deficient murine macrophage cell line,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4960141/,"Metabolic and immune mediators activate many of the same signal transduction pathways. Therefore, molecules that regulate metabolism often affect immune responses. Leptin is an adipokine that exemplifies this interplay. Leptin is the body’s major nutritional status sensor, but it also plays a key role in immune system regulation. To provide an in vitro tool to investigate the link between leptin and innate immunity, we immortalized and characterized a leptin receptor-deficient macrophage cell line, DB-1. The cell line was created using bone marrow cells from leptin receptor-deficient mice. Bone marrow cells were differentiated into macrophages by culturing them with recombinant mouse macrophage colony stimulating factor, and passaged when confluent for 6 months. The cells spontaneously immortalized at approximately passage 20. Cells were cloned twice by limiting dilution cloning prior to characterization. The macrophage cell line is diploid and grows at a linear rate for 4–5 days before reaching the growth plateau. The cells are MAC-2 and F4/80 positive and have phagocytic activity similar to primary macrophages from wild-type and leptin receptor-deficient mice. DB-1 cells were responsive to stimulation with interferon-γ as measured by increase in Nos2 transcript levels. In addition, DB-1 macrophages are not responsive to the chemotactic signaling of adipocyte conditioned media nor leptin when compared to primary WT macrophages. We believe that DB-1 cells provide a dependable tool to study the role of leptin or the leptin receptor in obesity-associated inflammation and immune system dysregulation.

Validation of methods to assess the immunoglobulin gene repertoire in tissues obtained from mice on the International Space Station.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5736159/,"Spaceflight is known to affect immune cell populations. In particular, splenic B cell numbers decrease during spaceflight and in ground-based physiological models. Although antibody isotype changes have been assessed during and after space flight, an extensive characterization of the impact of spaceflight on antibody composition has not been conducted in mice. Next Generation Sequencing and bioinformatic tools are now available to assess antibody repertoires. We can now identify immunoglobulin gene- segment usage, junctional regions, and modifications that contribute to specificity and diversity. Due to limitations on the International Space Station, alternate sample collection and storage methods must be employed. Our group compared Illumina MiSeq sequencing data from multiple sample preparation methods in normal C57Bl/6J mice to validate that sample preparation and storage would not bias the outcome of antibody repertoire characterization. In this report, we also compared sequencing techniques and a bioinformatic workflow on the data output when we assessed the IgH and Igκ variable gene usage. This included assessments of our bioinformatic workflow on Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq datasets and is specifically designed to reduce bias, capture the most information from Ig sequences, and produce a data set that provides other data mining options. We validated our workflow by comparing our normal mouse MiSeq data to existing murine antibody repertoire studies validating it for future antibody repertoire studies.

Characterization of the naive murine antibody repertoire using unamplified high-throughput sequencing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5761896/,"Antibody specificity and diversity are generated through the enzymatic splicing of genomic gene segments within each B cell. Antibodies are heterodimers of heavy- and light-chains encoded on separate loci. We studied the antibody repertoire from pooled, splenic tissue of unimmunized, adult female C57BL/6J mice, using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) without amplification of antibody transcripts. We recovered over 90,000 heavy-chain and over 135,000 light-chain immunoglobulin sequences. Individual V-, D-, and J-gene segment usage was uniform among the three mouse pools, particularly in highly abundant gene segments, with low frequency V-gene segments not being detected in all pools. Despite the similar usage of individual gene segments, the repertoire of individual B-cell CDR3 amino acid sequences in each mouse pool was highly varied, affirming the combinatorial diversity in the B-cell pool that has been previously demonstrated. There also was some skewing in the V-gene segments that were detected depending on chromosomal location.

Effects of spaceflight on the immunoglobulin repertoire of unimmunized C57BL/6 mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5826609/,"Spaceflight has been shown to suppress the adaptive immune response, altering the distribution and function of lymphocyte populations. B lymphocytes express highly specific and highly diversified receptors, known as immunoglobulins (Ig), that directly bind and neutralize pathogens. Ig diversity is achieved through the enzymatic splicing of gene segments within the genomic DNA of each B cell in a host. The collection of Ig specificities within a host, or Ig repertoire, has been increasingly characterized in both basic research and clinical settings using high-throughput sequencing technology (HTS). We utilized HTS to test the hypothesis that spaceflight affects the B-cell repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the unimmunized Ig repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to ground controls. Individual gene segment usage was similar between ground control and flight animals, however, gene segment combinations and the junctions in which gene segments combine was varied among animals within and between treatment groups. We also found that spontaneous somatic mutations in the IgH and Igκ gene loci were not increased. These data suggest that space flight did not affect the B cell repertoire of mice flown and housed on the ISS over a short period of time.

A comparison of unamplified and massively multiplexed PCR amplification for murine antibody repertoire sequencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6366624/,"Sequencing antibody repertoires has steadily become cheaper and easier. Sequencing methods usually rely on some form of amplification, often a massively multiplexed PCR prior to sequencing. To eliminate potential biases and create a data set that could be used for other studies, our lab compared unamplified sequencing results from the splenic heavy-chain repertoire in the mouse to those processed through two commercial applications. We also compared the use of mRNA vs total RNA, reverse transcriptase, and primer usage for cDNA synthesis and submission. The use of mRNA for cDNA synthesis resulted in higher read counts but reverse transcriptase and primer usage had no statistical effects on read count. Although most of the amplified data sets contained more antibody reads than the unamplified data set, we detected more unique V-gene segments in the unamplified data set. Although unique CDR3 detection was much lower in the unamplified data set, RNASeq detected 98% of the high frequency CDR3s. We have shown that unamplified profiling of the antibody repertoire is possible, detects more V-gene segments, and detects high frequency clones in the repertoire.

Effects of skeletal unloading on the antibody repertoire of tetanus toxoid and/or CpG treated C57BL/6J mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11929063/,"This report concerns the preclinical development of TAK-754, an AAV8-based human factor VIII (FVIII) vector designed to deliver a codon-optimized and CpG-depleted B domain-deleted F8 transgene under the control of a liver-specific promoter for gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A. A dose-dependent increase in plasma FVIII activity was detected in FVIII knockout mice at a dose of 1.0 × 10 12 TAK-754 capsid particles (CP)/kg or higher. This increase was shown to be in accordance with a dose-dependent decrease in blood loss in a hemostatic efficacy assay. TAK-754 (3.1 × 10 12 CP/kg) mediated long-term and stable FVIII expression in immunologically tolerant transgenic human FVIII mice. Toxicology and biodistribution assessments with a single administration of TAK-754 ranging between 1.9 × 10 12 and 5.0 × 10 13 CP/kg were conducted in male C57BL/6J mice. The highest TAK-754 dose occurred without TAK-754-related adverse clinical signs. Biodistribution profiling showed predominant detection in the liver with a low occurrence of vector DNA in other tissues. Integration site analysis revealed minimal vector integration, with no observations of clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in genes previously implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma formation within the observation period. These preclinical studies demonstrate a good safety and efficacy profile for TAK-754.

An Analysis of the Effects of Spaceflight and Vaccination on Antibody Repertoire Diversity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10996920/,"Ab repertoire diversity plays a critical role in the host’s ability to fight pathogens. CDR3 is partially responsible for Ab–Ag binding and is a significant source of diversity in the repertoire. CDR3 diversity is generated during VDJ rearrangement because of gene segment selection, gene segment trimming and splicing, and the addition of nucleotides. We analyzed the Ab repertoire diversity across multiple experiments examining the effects of spaceflight on the Ab repertoire after vaccination. Five datasets from four experiments were analyzed using rank-abundance curves and Shannon indices as measures of diversity. We discovered a trend toward lower diversity as a result of spaceflight but did not find the same decrease in our physiological model of microgravity in either the spleen or bone marrow. However, the bone marrow repertoire showed a reduction in diversity after vaccination. We also detected differences in Shannon indices between experiments and tissues. We did not detect a pattern of CDR3 usage across the experiments. Overall, we were able to find differences in the Ab repertoire diversity across experimental groups and tissues.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-nihpa.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7ccd/10996920/1f685c510162/nihms-1980322-f0001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7ccd/10996920/290c0a286dd5/nihms-1980322-f0002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7ccd/10996920/de4d3ba4e342/nihms-1980322-f0003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7ccd/10996920/5c178d9b688d/nihms-1980322-f0004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7ccd/10996920/7f90917b8936/nihms-1980322-f0005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7ccd/10996920/52d69f2af680/nihms-1980322-f0006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7ccd/10996920/c9144e498455/nihms-1980322-f0007.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7ccd/10996920/9d0a4479ac9b/nihms-1980322-f0008.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7ccd/10996920/bb2bb9afe1a6/nihms-1980322-f0009.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Effects of spaceflight aboard the International Space Station on mouse estrous cycle and ovarian gene expression,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7954810/,"Ovarian steroids dramatically impact normal homeostatic and metabolic processes of most tissues within the body, including muscle, bone, neural, immune, cardiovascular, and reproductive systems. Determining the effects of spaceflight on the ovary and estrous cycle is, therefore, critical to our understanding of all spaceflight experiments using female mice. Adult female mice ( n = 10) were exposed to and sacrificed on-orbit after 37 days of spaceflight in microgravity. Contemporary control (preflight baseline, vivarium, and habitat; n = 10/group) groups were maintained at the Kennedy Space Center, prior to sacrifice and similar tissue collection at the NASA Ames Research Center. Ovarian tissues were collected and processed for RNA and steroid analyses at initial carcass thaw. Vaginal wall tissue collected from twice frozen/thawed carcasses was fixed for estrous cycle stage determinations. The proportion of animals in each phase of the estrous cycle (i.e., proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus) did not appreciably differ between baseline, vivarium, and flight mice, while habitat control mice exhibited greater numbers in diestrus. Ovarian tissue steroid concentrations indicated no differences in estradiol across groups, while progesterone levels were lower ( p < 0.05) in habitat and flight compared to baseline females. Genes involved in ovarian steroidogenic function were not differentially expressed across groups. As ovarian estrogen can dramatically impact multiple non-reproductive tissues, these data support vaginal wall estrous cycle classification of all female mice flown in space. Additionally, since females exposed to long-term spaceflight were observed at different estrous cycle stages, this indicates females are likely undergoing ovarian cyclicity and may yet be fertile.

Spaceflight promotes biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3639165/,"Understanding the effects of spaceflight on microbial communities is crucial for the success of long-term, manned space missions. Surface-associated bacterial communities, known as biofilms, were abundant on the Mir space station and continue to be a challenge on the International Space Station. The health and safety hazards linked to the development of biofilms are of particular concern due to the suppression of immune function observed during spaceflight. While planktonic cultures of microbes have indicated that spaceflight can lead to increases in growth and virulence, the effects of spaceflight on biofilm development and physiology remain unclear. To address this issue, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured during two Space Shuttle Atlantis missions: STS-132 and STS-135, and the biofilms formed during spaceflight were characterized. Spaceflight was observed to increase the number of viable cells, biofilm biomass, and thickness relative to normal gravity controls. Moreover, the biofilms formed during spaceflight exhibited a column-and-canopy structure that has not been observed on Earth. The increase in the amount of biofilms and the formation of the novel architecture during spaceflight were observed to be independent of carbon source and phosphate concentrations in the media. However, flagella-driven motility was shown to be essential for the formation of this biofilm architecture during spaceflight. These findings represent the first evidence that spaceflight affects community-level behaviors of bacteria and highlight the importance of understanding how both harmful and beneficial human-microbe interactions may be altered during spaceflight.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/187b/3639165/9e4b19a49cfe/pone.0062437.e001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/187b/3639165/a73b7e4c865c/pone.0062437.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/187b/3639165/f39f7afda482/pone.0062437.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/187b/3639165/5c71d2864384/pone.0062437.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/187b/3639165/0bc20407b8fc/pone.0062437.g004.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

This large collection of data enables the exploration of molecular network responses to space environments using a systems biology approach. We review here the various components of the GeneLab platform, including the new data repository web interface, and the GeneLab Online Data Entry (GEODE) web portal, which will support the expansion of the database in the future to include companion non-omics assay data. We discuss our design for GEODE, particularly how it promotes investigators providing more accurate metadata, reducing the curation effort required of GeneLab staff. We also introduce here a new GeneLab Application Programming Interface (API) specifically designed to support tools for the visualization of processed omics data. We review the outreach efforts by GeneLab to utilize the spaceflight data in the repository to generate novel discoveries and develop new hypotheses, including spearheading data analysis working groups, and a high school student training program.

Knowledge Network Embedding of Transcriptomic Data from Spaceflown Mice Uncovers Signs and Symptoms Associated with Terrestrial Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7828077/,"There has long been an interest in understanding how the hazards from spaceflight may trigger or exacerbate human diseases. With the goal of advancing our knowledge on physiological changes during space travel, NASA GeneLab provides an open-source repository of multi-omics data from real and simulated spaceflight studies. Alone, this data enables identification of biological changes during spaceflight, but cannot infer how that may impact an astronaut at the phenotypic level. To bridge this gap, Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine (SPOKE), a heterogeneous knowledge graph connecting biological and clinical data from over 30 databases, was used in combination with GeneLab transcriptomic data from six studies.

Spatially resolved multiomics on the neuronal effects induced by spaceflight in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166911/,"Impairment of the central nervous system (CNS) poses a significant health risk for astronauts during long-duration space missions. In this study, we employed an innovative approach by integrating single-cell multiomics (transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility) with spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the impact of spaceflight on the mouse brain in female mice. Our comparative analysis between ground control and spaceflight-exposed animals revealed significant alterations in essential brain processes including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission, particularly affecting the cortex, hippocampus, striatum and neuroendocrine structures. Additionally, we observed astrocyte activation and signs of immune dysfunction. At the pathway level, some spaceflight-induced changes in the brain exhibit similarities with neurodegenerative disorders, marked by oxidative stress and protein misfolding. Our integrated spatial multiomics approach serves as a stepping stone towards understanding spaceflight-induced CNS impairments at the level of individual brain regions and cell types, and provides a basis for comparison in future spaceflight studies. For broader scientific impact, all datasets from this study are available through an interactive data portal, as well as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Open Science Data Repository (OSDR).

The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) provides transparent and FAIR access to biological studies, notably the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission, which amassed extensive data from civilian astronauts. This dataset encompasses omics and clinical assays, facilitating comprehensive research on space-induced biological responses. These data allow for multi-modal, longitudinal assessments, bridging the gap between human and model organism studies. Crucially, community-driven data standards established by NASA’s OSDR Analysis Working Groups empower artificial intelligence and machine learning to glean invaluable insights, guiding future mission planning and health risk mitigation. This article presents a concise guide to access and analyze I4 data in OSDR, including programmatic access through GLOpenAPI. This pioneering effort establishes a precedent for post-mission health monitoring programs within space agencies, propelling research in the burgeoning field of commercial space travel’s impact on human physiology.

NASA GeneLab derived microarray studies of Mus musculus and Homo sapiens organisms in altered gravitational conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11053165/,"One of the greatest challenges of humanity for deep space exploration is to fully understand how altered gravitational conditions affect human physiology. It is evident that the spaceflight environment causes multiple alterations to musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, immune and central nervous systems, to name a few known effects. To better characterize these biological effects, we compare gene expression datasets from microarray studies found in NASA GeneLab, part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository. In this review, we summarize these archived results for various tissues, emphasizing key genes which are highly reproducible in different mice or human experiments. Such exhaustive mining shows the potential of NASA Open Science data to identify and validate mechanisms taking place when mammalian organisms are exposed to microgravity or other spaceflight conditions. Our comparative meta-analysis findings highlight certain degrees of overlap and reproducibility in genes identified as differentially expressed within musculoskeletal tissues in each species across a variety of altered gravity conditions. However, the level of overlap between species was found to be significantly limited, partly attributed to the limited availability of human samples.

Fungal diversity differences in the indoor dust microbiome from built environments on Earth and in space.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11126634/,"Human occupied built environments are no longer confined to Earth. In fact, there have been humans living and working in low-Earth orbit on the International Space Station (ISS) since November 2000. With NASA’s Artemis missions and the age of commercial space stations set to begin, more human-occupied spacecraft than ever will be in Earth’s orbit and beyond. On Earth and in the ISS, microbes, especially fungi, can be found in dust and grow when unexpected, elevated moisture conditions occur. However, we do not yet know how indoor microbiomes in Earth-based homes and in the ISS differ due to their unique set of environmental conditions. Here we show that bacterial and fungal communities are different in dust collected from vacuum bags on Earth and the ISS, with Earth-based homes being more diverse (465 fungal OTUs and 237 bacterial ASVs) compared to the ISS (102 fungal OTUs and 102 bacterial ASVs). When dust from these locations were exposed to varying equilibrium relative humidity conditions (ERH), there were also significant fungal community composition changes as ERH and time elevated increased (Bray Curtis: R 2 = 0.35, P = 0.001). These findings can inform future spacecraft design to promote healthy indoor microbiomes that support crew health, spacecraft integrity, and planetary protection.

Aging and estrogen status: A possible endothelium-dependent vascular coupling mechanism in bone remodeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3502426/,"Bone loss with aging and menopause may be linked to vascular endothelial dysfunction. The purpose of the study was to determine whether putative modifications in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur are associated with changes in trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) with altered estrogen status in young (6 mon) and old (24 mon) female Fischer-344 rats. Animals were divided into 6 groups: 1) young intact, 2) old intact, 3) young ovariectomized (OVX), 4) old OVX, 5) young OVX plus estrogen replacement (OVX+E2), and 6) old OVX+E2. PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation was assessed in vitro using acetylcholine. Trabecular bone volume of the distal femoral metaphysis was determined by microCT. In young rats, vasodilation was diminished by OVX and restored with estrogen replacement (intact, 82±7; OVX, 61±9; OVX+E2, 90±4%), which corresponded with similar modifications in BV/TV (intact, 28.7±1.6; OVX, 16.3±0.9; OVX+E2, 25.7±1.4%). In old animals, vasodilation was unaffected by OVX but enhanced with estrogen replacement (intact, 55±8; OVX, 59±7; OVX+E2, 92±4%). Likewise, modifications in BV/TV followed the same pattern (intact, 33.1±1.6; OVX, 34.4±3.7; OVX+E2, 42.4±2.1%). Furthermore, in old animals with low endogenous estrogen (i.e., intact and old OVX), vasodilation was correlated with BV/TV (R 2 = 0.630; P<0.001). These data demonstrate parallel effects of estrogen on vascular endothelial function and BV/TV, and provide for a possible coupling mechanism linking endothelium-dependent vasodilation to bone remodeling.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bb5c/3502426/96ff209482ae/pone.0048564.e001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bb5c/3502426/571354569923/pone.0048564.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bb5c/3502426/eb98de98c723/pone.0048564.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bb5c/3502426/607f414c84cb/pone.0048564.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bb5c/3502426/f175ba3558fb/pone.0048564.g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bb5c/3502426/6c515efa906d/pone.0048564.g005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bb5c/3502426/50f07475b694/pone.0048564.g006.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Chronic skeletal unloading of the rat femur: mechanisms and functional consequences of vascular remodeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3856860/,"Chronic skeletal unloading diminishes hindlimb bone blood flow. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine 1) whether 7 and 14 days of skeletal unloading alters femoral bone and marrow blood flow and vascular resistance during reloading, and 2) whether putative changes in bone perfusion are associated with a gross structural remodeling of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur. Six-month old male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 7-d or 14-d hindlimb unloading (HU) or weight-bearing control groups. Bone perfusion was measured following 10 min of standing (reloading) following the unloading treatment. Histomorphometry was used to determine PNA media wall thickness and maximal diameter. Bone blood flow, arterial pressure and PNA structural characteristics were used to calculate arterial shear stress and circumferential wall stress. During reloading, femoral perfusion was lower in the distal metaphyseal region of 7-d HU rats, and in the proximal and distal metaphyses, diaphysis and diaphyseal marrow of 14-d HU animals relative to that in control rats. Vascular resistance was also higher in all regions of the femur in 14-d HU rats during reloading relative to control animals. Intraluminal diameter of PNAs from 14-d HU rats (138 ± 5 μm) was smaller than that of control PNAs (162 ± 6 μm), and medial wall thickness was thinner in PNAs from 14-d HU (14.3 ± 0.6 μm) versus that of control (18.0 ± 0.8 μm) rats. Decreases in both shear stress and circumferential stress occurred in the PNA with HU that later returned to control levels with the reductions in PNA maximal diameter and wall thickness, respectively. The results demonstrate that chronic skeletal unloading attenuates the ability to increase blood flow and nutrient delivery to bone and marrow with immediate acute reloading due, in part, to a remodeling of the bone resistance vasculature.

Differential effects of aging and exercise on intra-abdominal adipose arteriolar function and blood flow regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3615599/,"Adipose tissue (AT), which typically comprises an increased percentage of body mass with advancing age, receives a large proportion of resting cardiac output. During exercise, an old age-associated inability to increase vascular resistance within the intra-abdominal AT may compromise the ability of the cardiovascular system to redistribute blood flow to the active musculature, contributing to the decline in exercise capacity observed in this population. We tested the hypotheses that 1 ) there would be an elevated perfusion of AT during exercise with old age that was associated with diminished vasoconstrictor responses of adipose-resistance arteries, and 2 ) chronic exercise training would mitigate the age-associated alterations in AT blood flow and vascular function. Young (6 mo; n = 40) and old (24 mo; n = 28) male Fischer 344 rats were divided into young sedentary (YSed), old sedentary (OSed), young exercise trained (YET), or old exercise trained (OET) groups, where training consisted of 10-12 wk of treadmill exercise. In vivo blood flow at rest and during exercise and in vitro α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstrictor responses in resistance arteries from AT were measured in all groups. In response to exercise, there was a directionally opposite change in AT blood flow in the OSed group (∼150% increase) and YSed (∼55% decrease) vs. resting values. Both α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction were diminished in OSed vs. YSed AT-resistance arteries. Exercise training resulted in a similar AT hyperemic response between age groups during exercise (YET, 9.9 ± 0.5 ml·min −1 ·100 −1 g; OET, 8.1 ± 0.9 ml·min −1 ·100 −1 g) and was associated with enhanced myogenic and α-adrenergic vasoconstriction of AT-resistance arteries from the OET group relative to OSed. These results indicate that there is an inability to increase vascular resistance in AT during exercise with old age, due, in part, to a diminished vasoconstriction of AT arteries. Furthermore, the results indicate that exercise training can augment vasoconstriction of AT arteries and mitigate age-related alterations in the regulation of AT blood flow during exercise.

by the year 2030, individuals, 85 years and older, will constitute the fastest-growing segment of the population in the United States ( 1 ), and aging is associated with a decline in maximal exercise capacity ( 23 , 41 , 55 , 57 , 59 , 72 ), which may contribute to the adoption of a more sedentary lifestyle. During the transition from rest to exercise, a rapid redistribution of peripheral blood flow is essential to maintain central venous return and the instantaneous elevation of cardiac output ( 30 ), as well as augment oxygen (O 2 ) delivery to the active musculature to match the immediate increase (≤2 s) in O 2 consumption ( 7 ). However, during exercise ( 52 ), heat stress ( 38 ), and orthostatic challenges ( 61 ), whole-body hemodynamics (i.e., cardiac output distribution and perturbations in arterial pressure) are altered in old vs. young subjects. In particular, during exercise, old age-associated alterations in muscle blood flow ( 10 , 21 , 46 , 77 ) result in a mismatching of O 2 delivery to O 2 consumption ( 9 , 14 , 22 ), which would expectedly contribute to an age-related functional decline. Whether aging affects the distribution of blood flow to other tissues, such as adipose tissue (AT), during exercise remains to be determined.
We have demonstrated recently that arterial pressure in old rats decreases during an orthostatic challenge, which was associated with an inability to elevate vascular resistance in white AT ( 61 ). Furthermore, there was a severely diminished α-adrenergic vasoconstriction in AT-resistance arteries with old age ( 61 ). Given that AT makes up a greater proportion of body composition with aging in rats ( 18 ) and humans ( 11 ), a reduced vasoconstriction of resistance vessels from this tissue could have significant ramifications on the ability to regulate AT blood flow in aged individuals to maintain arterial pressure and muscle blood flow during exercise ( 19 ).
The primary role of white AT is the storage and mobilization of lipids. However, white AT is also regarded as an endocrine organ ( 27 ), as white adipocytes produce mediators that influence metabolism of lipids and glucose and immune responses ( 73 , 74 ). Regulation of AT blood flow is complex and largely influenced by pathologies {e.g., type II diabetes and insulin resistance ( 28 , 36 ), body composition [obesity ( 71 )], nutritional state [fasting vs. postprandial ( 70 )], and the anatomical location of AT [e.g., central vs. peripheral; for review, see Sotornik et al. ( 64 )]}. Although white AT lacks significant parasympathetic innervation ( 29 ), there is substantial neuroanatomical and neurochemical evidence of a differential sympathetic nervous system (SNS) innervation depending on anatomical location [for review, see Bartness and Bamshad ( 5 )]. Electrical stimulation of nerves innervating white AT results in a vasoconstriction that is abolished by the α-adrenergic receptor blockade ( 54 ), suggesting that the regulation of AT blood flow is influenced largely by the SNS. During short-duration exercise (<30 min) in young, healthy subjects, there is an immediate decrease in blood flow to the viscera ( 2 ), as well as subcutaneous and epididymal AT ( 45 ), likely consequent to activation of sympathetic vasoconstrictor neurons. The reduction of blood flow to these tissues during exercise contributes, in part, to the effective redistribution of cardiac output to maximize perfusion of the active musculature and maintenance of systemic vascular resistance ( 2 , 19 ). However, given the old age-associated diminution of α-adrenergic vasoconstriction in resistance arteries from white AT ( 61 ), it is likely that AT blood flow will either remain similar to resting values or possibly be elevated during the transition from rest to exercise with old age.
As AT receives a large proportion of cardiac output (∼8–12%) under normal resting conditions ( 18 ), old age-associated alterations in AT blood flow could have significant consequences on the ability to redirect blood flow to active tissue during physical activity in the elderly population. However, the effects of aging and exercise on AT blood flow are unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to test the hypotheses that with old age, 1 ) there is an inability to modulate AT blood flow during short-duration dynamic exercise, and 2 ) the altered adipose blood flow response with old age will be associated with a diminished α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction of resistance arteries from AT. Given the ability of exercise training to enhance adrenergic vasoconstriction in muscle that is not actively recruited during exercise ( 43 ), as well as myogenic vasoconstriction ( 50 ), the second part of this study was to determine whether chronic exercise training can 1 ) mitigate putative alterations in AT perfusion during exercise and 2 ) improve α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction in adipose-resistance arteries.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-jap.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/024d/3615599/9df2dbe6153c/zdg0061305140001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/024d/3615599/77b9991aa63b/zdg0061305140002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/024d/3615599/993823235df8/zdg0061305140003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/024d/3615599/fccca2cbb16c/zdg0061305140004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/024d/3615599/f28198fdd64f/zdg0061305140005.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Effects of spaceflight and ground recovery on mesenteric artery and vein constrictor properties in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4050424/,"Following exposure to microgravity, there is a reduced ability of astronauts to augment peripheral vascular resistance, often resulting in orthostatic hypotension. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that mesenteric arteries and veins will exhibit diminished vasoconstrictor responses after spaceflight. Mesenteric arteries and veins from female mice flown on the Space Transportation System (STS)-131 ( n =11), STS-133 ( n =6), and STS-135 ( n =3) shuttle missions and respective ground-based control mice ( n =30) were isolated for in vitro experimentation. Vasoconstrictor responses were evoked in arteries via norepinephrine (NE), potassium chloride (KCl), and caffeine, and in veins through NE across a range of intraluminal pressures (2–12 cmH 2 O). Vasoconstriction to NE was also determined in mesenteric arteries at 1, 5, and 7 d postlanding. In arteries, maximal constriction to NE, KCl, and caffeine were reduced immediately following spaceflight and 1 d postflight. Spaceflight also reduced arterial ryanodine receptor-3 mRNA levels. In mesenteric veins, there was diminished constriction to NE after flight. The results indicate that the impaired vasoconstriction following spaceflight occurs through the ryanodine receptor-mediated intracellular Ca 2+ release mechanism. Such vascular changes in astronauts could compromise the maintenance of arterial pressure during orthostatic stress.—Behnke, B. J., Stabley, J. N., McCullough, D. J., Davis, R. T., III, Dominguez, J.

Keywords: orthostatic hypotension, microgravity, microcirculation
Orthostatic hypotension was found to manifest among the astronauts of Project Mercury after only brief excursions into space, making this condition one of the first medical complications reported to occur in astronauts ( 1 , 2 ). Following short-term flight (2–3 wk) on the space shuttle, 20–50% of astronauts exhibit orthostatic hypotension when reexposed to normal gravitational stress ( 3 – 5 ), with the prevalence of this condition rising markedly after longer term (4–6 mo) habitation in microgravity ( 6 ). This orthostatic hypotension is due, in part, to a diminished ability to elevate peripheral vascular resistance (PVR; refs. 3 , 7 – 9 ). One possible mechanism for the impaired ability to elevate PVR following spaceflight is a reduced magnitude or rate of vasoconstriction of the arterial resistance vasculature. Ground-based human and animal models used to simulate the effects of microgravity suggest decrements in vasoconstrictor responsiveness of arterial segments in various regions of the body, including the splanchnic circulation ( 10 – 13 ), as a potential mechanism contributing to orthostatic hypotension in astronauts.
In the face of a spaceflight-associated reduction in PVR, cardiac output would have to be augmented in order to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) during an orthostatic challenge. However, the ability to augment cardiac output following simulated microgravity is diminished, owing to decrements in stroke volume ( 14 , 15 ). Venous filling pressure can affect stroke volume via the Starling mechanism and is largely regulated by systemic venous capacitance, of which the splanchnic region has the greatest capacitance ( 16 ). Because veins from the mesentery are responsive to sympathetic activity ( 17 ), active baroreceptor-mediated venoconstriction would mobilize mesenteric venous blood volume centrally to maintain venous filling pressure and stroke volume, while a diminished adrenergic and/or myogenic constriction of mesenteric veins after spaceflight would impair this process. Previous investigations simulating microgravity in rats have demonstrated diminished adrenergic and pressure-induced constriction of mesenteric veins ( 13 , 18 ). However, little is known about the effects of spaceflight on the intrinsic vaso- or venoconstrictor properties of the mesenteric vasculature or whether putative alterations in vasomotor responses are reversible. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of microgravity on intrinsic vasomotor properties of mesenteric arteries and veins from mice flown on the Space Transportation System (STS)-131, STS-133, and STS-135 shuttle missions. Based on previous results from studies using ground-based simulations of microgravity ( 12 , 13 , 18 ), we hypothesized that spaceflight will diminish the magnitude of adrenergic KCl- and caffeine-evoked vasoconstriction in mesenteric arteries, and that this decrement will be related to altered sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ handling; and that spaceflight will blunt adrenergic constriction of mesenteric veins across a range of intraluminal pressures. In addition, we hypothesized that the putative decrements in adrenergic vasoconstriction are reversible within 1 wk of return to Earth's gravitational influences.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-fasebj.gif"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c4bc/4050424/ac67ec0561fa/z380011390890001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c4bc/4050424/6821739696e5/z380011390890002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c4bc/4050424/7dc4a8731a96/z380011390890003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c4bc/4050424/111024bb3a65/z380011390890004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c4bc/4050424/afe9c6737ec6/z380011390890005.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
"Spaceflight-induced alterations in cerebral artery vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and structural properties: Implications for elevated cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3659353/,"Evidence indicates that cerebral blood flow is both increased and diminished in astronauts on return to Earth. Data from ground-based animal models simulating the effects of microgravity have shown that decrements in cerebral perfusion are associated with enhanced vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of cerebral arteries. Based on these results, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 13 d of spaceflight [Space Transportation System (STS)-135 shuttle mission] enhances myogenic vasoconstriction, increases medial wall thickness, and elicits no change in the mechanical properties of mouse cerebral arteries. Basilar and posterior communicating arteries (PCAs) were isolated from 9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice for in vitro vascular and mechanical testing. Contrary to that hypothesized, myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were lower and vascular distensibility greater in arteries from spaceflight group (SF) mice ( n =7) relative to ground-based control group (GC) mice ( n =12). Basilar artery maximal diameter was greater in SF mice (SF: 236±9 μm and GC: 215±5 μm) with no difference in medial wall thickness (SF: 12.4±1.6 μm; GC: 12.2±1.2 μm). Stiffness of the PCA, as characterized via nanoindentation, was lower in SF mice (SF: 3.4±0.3 N/m; GC: 5.4±0.8 N/m). Collectively, spaceflight-induced reductions in myogenic vasoconstriction and stiffness and increases in maximal diameter of cerebral arteries signify that elevations in brain blood flow may occur during spaceflight. Such changes in cerebral vascular control of perfusion could contribute to increases in intracranial pressure and an associated impairment of visual acuity in astronauts during spaceflight.—Taylor, C.

Spaceflight-induced alterations in cerebral artery vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and structural properties: implications for elevated cerebral perfusion and intracranial pressure.
Keywords: microgravity, brain blood flow, hemodynamics
Approximately 29% of astronauts on short-term (∼2 wk) space shuttle flights and 60% on long-duration (∼6 mo) missions to the International Space Station (ISS) are reported to have experienced some impairment in distant or near visual acuity ( 1 ). These visual disturbances have been hypothesized to be related to increases in intracranial pressure ( 1 – 3 ). An increase in intracranial pressure associated with spaceflight could occur through several mechanisms, including the movement of arterial, venous, and cerebrospinal fluids toward the head due to the loss of the head-to-foot gravity vector present on Earth. However, given autoregulatory mechanisms that prevent cerebral perfusion from increasing in the presence of elevations in arterial perfusion pressure ( 4 , 5 ), a putative rise in cerebral arterial pressure ( P a ) of 20–30 mmHg in a microgravity environment ( 6 ) would not be expected to increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) and, correspondingly, fluid filtration into the cranium to drive elevations in intracranial pressure.
Ground-based animal studies in rats subjected to chronic head-down tail suspension (HDT) have been conducted to simulate the cephalad fluid shift ( 7 – 10 ) and general cardiovascular deconditioning ( 11 , 12 ) that occurs with spaceflight. In the HDT animal model, elevations in P a to the head result in decreases in CBF ( 13 , 14 ), increases in the intrinsic vasoconstrictor responsiveness of cerebral arteries ( 14 – 18 ), and remodeling of the cerebral arterial vasculature that is characterized by the thickening of the medial smooth muscle cell layer and, in some cerebral arteries, a decrease in maximal intraluminal diameter ( 14 , 16 , 19 , 20 ).
To date, no studies have been conducted to determine the effects of actual microgravity on the function and structure of cerebral arteries. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine whether spaceflight alters the intrinsic myogenic vasoconstrictor, mechanical, and gross structural properties of cerebral arteries from mice flown on the Space Transportation System (STS-135) shuttle mission. Based on experimental results from HDT rats ( 14 , 15 , 20 ), we hypothesized that myogenic vasoconstriction would be enhanced, the passive pressure-diameter relation and mechanical stiffness would be unchanged, and medial wall thickness would be increased in cerebral arteries from spaceflight group (SF) mice relative to that in ground-based control group (GC) animals. The results show that the effects of actual microgravity on the mouse cerebral arteries were unlike those of simulated microgravity with HDT rats. To estimate whether these divergent findings are the result of conditions unique to a space environment or the result of species differences between mice and rats, a second set of experiments was conducted to determine the effects of HDT on mouse cerebral artery myogenic vasoconstriction, passive pressure-diameter response, and gross structure.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-fasebj.gif"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b6a3/3659353/b8ee75de25af/z380061392550001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b6a3/3659353/a54d1d6a369a/z380061392550002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b6a3/3659353/33319a6ad7fb/z380061392550003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b6a3/3659353/f6eeef957989/z380061392550004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b6a3/3659353/d0130341fadf/z380061392550005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b6a3/3659353/0c3da7ca44ab/z380061392550006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b6a3/3659353/a8d59b6e5ef8/z380061392550007.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b6a3/3659353/c86b0af5f750/z380061392550008.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

Effects of Skeletal Unloading on the Vasomotor Properties of the Rat Femur Principal Nutrient Artery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4398884/,"Spaceflight and prolonged bed rest induce deconditioning of the cardiovascular system and bone loss. Previous research has shown declines in femoral bone and marrow perfusion during unloading and with subsequent reloading in hindlimb-unloaded (HU) rats, an animal model of chronic disuse. We hypothesized that the attenuated bone and marrow perfusion may result from altered vasomotor properties of the bone resistance vasculature. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of unloading on the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA), the main conduit for blood flow to the femur, in 2 wk HU and control (CON) rats. Vasoconstriction of the femoral PNA was assessed in vitro using norepinephrine, phenylephrine, clonidine, KCl, endothelin-1, arginine vasopressin, and myogenic responsiveness. Vasodilation through endothelium-dependent [acetylcholine, bradykinin, and flow-mediated dilation (FMD)] and endothelium-independent mechanisms [sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and adenosine] were also determined. Vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the PNA from HU rats was not enhanced through any of the mechanisms tested. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation to acetylcholine (CON, 86 ± 3%; HU, 48 ± 7% vasodilation) and FMD (CON, 61 ± 9%; HU, 11 ± 11% vasodilation) were attenuated in PNAs from HU rats, while responses to bradykinin were not different between groups. Endothelium-independent vasodilation to SNP and adenosine were not different between groups. These data indicate that unloading-induced decrements in bone and marrow perfusion and increases in vascular resistance are not the result of enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the bone resistance arteries but are associated with reductions in endothelium-dependent vasodilation.
Keywords: hindlimb unloading, bone blood flow, microcirculation
spaceflight and prolonged bed rest have been shown to have adverse effects on multiple organ systems. In the skeleton, chronic unloading of weight-bearing bones uncouples bone remodeling at the whole tissue level with rates of bone resorption elevated while formation rates remain largely unchanged. This uncoupling results in bone loss, a weaker skeleton, and increased risk of fracture in humans ( 34 , 57 ). Likewise, the cardiovascular system undergoes a deconditioning phenomenon with unloading that impairs its ability to properly regulate arterial pressure during orthostatic stress ( 7 , 58 ) and putative elevations in intracranial pressure ( 1 , 31 , 37 ) negatively affecting the cerebral circulation ( 1 , 54 ). There are few studies, however, that have examined the effects of spaceflight on the skeletal circulation, despite mounting evidence that bone perfusion, interstitial fluid flow, and direct vascular-bone cell coupling mechanisms modulate bone remodeling ( 5 , 8 , 12 , 20 , 25 , 43 , 55 , 56 ).
Using hindlimb-unloaded (HU) rats as a model for spaceflight and disuse, investigators have reported reduced cancellous bone mineral density, lower bone formation rates, and diminished mineral apposition rates in long bones of adult rats ( 4 , 13 ). In regard to the skeletal circulation, studies have shown a profound reduction in bone and marrow blood flow during unloading ( 12 , 52 ) and a blunting of the reloading hyperemia in bone and marrow when the animals resume weight-bearing activity ( 52 ). This decrement in the reloading hyperemia is the result of elevations in bone and marrow vascular resistance ( 52 ). Several factors could account for the reduced skeletal perfusion and increased vascular resistance with reloading, including 1 ) a structural remodeling of the resistance vasculature and vascular network, which has been shown to occur in long bones from HU rats ( 21 , 52 ); 2 ) an enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of bone resistance arteries; and 3 ) a diminished vasodilator responsiveness of the resistance vasculature. The purpose of the present study was to test these latter two possibilities. The principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur was selected for study because the PNA is the primary conduit for blood flow to long bones and accounts for ∼30% of the resistance to flow in the rat femur ( 6 , 29 ). We hypothesized that PNA vasoconstrictor responsiveness would be enhanced and that both endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilator responses would be impaired in 2-wk HU animals.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-jap.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f3b5/4398884/e22654399c32/zdg0071513640001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f3b5/4398884/423e08a11c48/zdg0071513640002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f3b5/4398884/fb0e43c26d8a/zdg0071513640003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f3b5/4398884/9581ffab2d99/zdg0071513640004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f3b5/4398884/c70efc888803/zdg0071513640005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f3b5/4398884/35a03ece61d7/zdg0071513640006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f3b5/4398884/9aa6accca50f/zdg0071513640007.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f3b5/4398884/9d106285b61e/zdg0071513640008.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Type 2 diabetes alters bone and marrow blood flow and vascular control mechanisms in the ZDF rat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4379453/,"Bone health and cardiovascular function are compromised in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Responses of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur from obese ZDF rats with prediabetes, short-term diabetes, and long-term diabetes to endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and –independent (sodium nitroprusside) vasodilation, and KCl, norepinephrine and myogenic vasoconstrictor were determined in vitro . Few changes in the PNA vasomotor responses occurred in the pre-diabetic and short-term diabetic conditions. Endothelium-dependent and –independent vasodilation were reduced, and norepinephrine and myogenic vasoconstriction were enhanced in obese ZDF rats with long-term diabetes relative to lean age-matched controls. Differences in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA between ZDF rats and controls were abolished by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N G -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. The passive pressure-diameter response of the femoral PNA was also lower across a range of intraluminal pressures with long-term T2DM. Regional bone and marrow perfusion and vascular conductance, measured in vivo using radiolabeled microspheres, were lower in obese ZDF rats with long-term diabetes. These findings suggest that the profound impairment of the bone circulation may contribute to the osteopenia found to occur in long bones with chronic T2DM.

Spaceflight on the Bion-M1 biosatellite alters cerebral artery vasomotor and mechanical properties in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4385880/,"Conditions during spaceflight, such as the loss of the head-to-foot gravity vector, are thought to potentially alter cerebral blood flow and vascular resistance. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of long-term spaceflight on the functional, mechanical, and structural properties of cerebral arteries. Male C57BL/6N mice were flown 30 days in a Bion-M1 biosatellite. Basilar arteries isolated from spaceflight (SF) ( n = 6), habitat control (HC) ( n = 6), and vivarium control (VC) ( n = 16) mice were used for in vitro functional and mechanical testing and histological structural analysis. The results demonstrate that vasoconstriction elicited through a voltage-gated Ca 2+ mechanism (30–80 mM KCl) and thromboxane A 2 receptors (10 −8 − 3 × 10 −5 M U46619) are lower in cerebral arteries from SF mice. Inhibition of Rho-kinase activity (1 μM Y27632) abolished group differences in U46619-evoked contractions. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation elicited by acetylcholine (10 μM, 2 μM U46619 preconstriction) was virtually absent in cerebral arteries from SF mice. The pressure-diameter relation was lower in arteries from SF mice relative to that in HC mice, which was not related to differences in the extracellular matrix protein elastin or collagen content or the elastin/collagen ratio in the basilar arteries. Diameter, medial wall thickness, and medial cross-sectional area of unpressurized basilar arteries were not different among groups. These results suggest that the microgravity-induced attenuation of both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties may limit the range of vascular control of cerebral perfusion or impair the distribution of brain blood flow during periods of stress.

travel and habitation in a microgravity environment represents a unique environmental stress to fluid homeostasis in the body. It has long been thought that the redistribution of fluids and fluid pressures within the cardiovascular system induce adaptations in cardiac and vascular structure and function, but that these adaptations posed no immediate in-flight health risk to cosmonauts and astronauts. However, recently reported changes in visual acuity among astronauts ( 2 , 31 , 36 ) has led to speculation that the fluid pressure redistribution in space and increases in intracranial pressure may be related to the development of this condition.
Spaceflight-induced increases in intracranial pressure could occur through several mechanisms, including elevations in arterial, venous, and cerebrospinal fluid pressures as these fluids undergo a cephalad shift with the loss of the head-to-foot gravity vector present on Earth. Although cerebral arterial pressure is thought to increase 20–30 mmHg in a microgravity environment ( 62 ), this pressure rise has been presumed to be offset by mechanisms of cerebral autoregulation to maintain cerebral blood flow, blood volume, and fluid filtration into the cranium at levels near that occurring on Earth ( 11 , 62 ).
The concept that cerebral perfusion remains unaltered during spaceflight has been challenged by results from the first study to examine isolated cerebral arteries from mice flown for 2 wk on the Space Shuttle ( 54 ). These data demonstrated that myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were diminished in basilar arteries from the shuttle mice, and that these arteries were mechanically less stiff and more distensible, resulting in larger intraluminal diameters across a range of physiological pressures. Although vasoconstrictor responses elicited through other mechanisms were not investigated, the finding of diminished myogenic vasoconstrictor tone was contrary to the enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of cerebral arteries through a variety of mechanisms in head-down tail-suspended rats ( 16 , 18 , 64 , 71 ), a ground-based rodent model to simulate microgravity-induced cephalad fluid shifts ( 12 , 20 , 38 , 45 ). On the basis of these findings, the authors hypothesized that microgravity represents a unique environmental stress whereby the cerebral circulation is not adequately modeled with ground-based simulations ( 54 ).
By using a 30-day mission on the Bion-M1 satellite, the purpose of the present study was 1 ) to define whether longer duration spaceflight diminishes vasoconstrictor responses and alters the mechanical behavior of mouse cerebral arteries, 2 ) to extend these observations to examine possible mechanisms for putative changes in vasoconstrictor responsiveness and mechanical properties, and 3 ) to determine whether spaceflight alters endothelium-dependent vasodilation of cerebral arteries. We hypothesized that vasoconstrictor responses acting through nonreceptor (voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels) and receptor (thromboxane A 2 ) mechanisms will be diminished in cerebral arteries from spaceflight (SF) mice relative to that in habitat control (HC) and vivarium control (VC) animals, and that cerebral arteries from SF mice will demonstrate greater distensibility and a corresponding increase in the elastin/collagen ratio. And finally, on the basis of the results of Zuj et al. ( 74 ) indicating a diminished endothelium-dependent vasodilation of cerebral arteries in astronauts, we hypothesized that endothelium-dependent vasodilation will be attenuated in cerebral arteries from SF mice.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-jap.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d069/4385880/90e21edc63dd/zdg0051513520001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d069/4385880/0c1c50571770/zdg0051513520002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d069/4385880/a702940ca445/zdg0051513520003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d069/4385880/d13640c7e494/zdg0051513520004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d069/4385880/0eaad17f6525/zdg0051513520005.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Apollo Lunar Astronauts Show Higher Cardiovascular Disease Mortality: Possible Deep Space Radiation Effects on the Vascular Endothelium,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4964660/,"As multiple spacefaring nations contemplate extended manned missions to Mars and the Moon, health risks could be elevated as travel goes beyond the Earth’s protective magnetosphere into the more intense deep space radiation environment. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, accidents and all other causes of death differ in (1) astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth’s magnetosphere. Results show there were no differences in CVD mortality rate between non-flight (9%) and LEO (11%) astronauts. However, the CVD mortality rate among Apollo lunar astronauts (43%) was 4–5 times higher than in non-flight and LEO astronauts. To test a possible mechanistic basis for these findings, a secondary purpose was to determine the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. The results demonstrate that space-relevant irradiation induces a sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Such impairment is known to lead to occlusive artery disease, and may be an important risk factor for CVD among astronauts exposed to deep space radiation.
The human experience with spaceflight has shown that space exploration comes with various health risks 1 , 2 , 3 . As humans contemplate manned missions to Mars or prolonged habitation on the Moon, these health risks will rise as the duration of spaceflight increases and as travel goes beyond the Earth’s protective magnetosphere 4 , 5 . During such interplanetary travel, astronauts will be exposed to multiple sources of ionizing radiation, including galactic cosmic rays, solar particle events, and trapped radiation in the Van Allen belts. Protons are the most abundant type of radiation in space, while heavier high atomic number and energy (HZE) ions such as 56 Fe produce complex tissue damage to molecules such as DNA that challenges cellular repair and recovery 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 .
Recent epidemiological studies have demonstrated increasing risk for cardiovascular disease resulting from ionizing radiation exposure 10 , 11 , 12 . However, these estimates are largely derived from low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation exposures such as X-rays or gamma rays, which have fundamentally different properties from charged HZE particles comprising the galactic cosmic rays. HZE ions, for example, produce greater adverse effects on cellular physiology through increased genetic alterations and perturbations to redox metabolism, leading to persistent elevations in oxidative stress 13 , 14 , 15 .
Despite the potential to be more biologically damaging, the long-term effect of space radiation on cardiovascular health has received little attention 16 , 17 , 18 . Therefore, the primary purpose of the present study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other causes of death differ in (1) non-flight astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled outside of the Earth’s geomagnetic field and into deep space.
A heightened risk for CVD among flight astronauts could be due to the direct effects of space radiation and weightlessness on the arterial vasculature. Using 56 Fe ion irradiation and hindlimb unloading (HU), a terrestrial rodent model that simulates the irradiation and musculoskeletal unloading that occurs during deep space travel 19 , 20 , the secondary purpose of this study was to determine whether simulated space radiation and weightlessness independently and jointly produce long-lasting vascular dysfunction that could lead to the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-scirep.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9959/4964660/7829da73c47a/srep29901-f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9959/4964660/b40e6010d431/srep29901-f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9959/4964660/9c2fa7dff866/srep29901-f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9959/4964660/ea6eb9f52d1c/srep29901-f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9959/4964660/66a8321ab3ba/srep29901-f5.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Effects of age and exercise training on coronary microvascular smooth muscle phenotype and function,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5866446/,"Coronary microvascular function and blood flow responses during acute exercise are impaired in the aged heart but can be restored by exercise training. Coronary microvascular resistance is directly dependent on vascular smooth muscle function in coronary resistance arterioles; therefore, we hypothesized that age impairs contractile function and alters the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle in coronary arterioles. We further hypothesized that exercise training restores contractile function and reverses age-induced phenotypic alterations of arteriolar smooth muscle. Young and old Fischer 344 rats underwent 10 wk of treadmill exercise training or remained sedentary. At the end of training or cage confinement, contractile responses, vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and expression of contractile proteins were assessed in isolated coronary arterioles. Both receptor- and non-receptor-mediated contractile function were impaired in coronary arterioles from aged rats. Vascular smooth muscle shifted from a differentiated, contractile phenotype to a secretory phenotype with associated proliferation of smooth muscle in the arteriolar wall. Expression of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 1 (SM1) was decreased in arterioles from aged rats, whereas expression of phospho-histone H3 and of the synthetic protein ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) were increased. Exercise training improved contractile responses, reduced smooth muscle proliferation and expression of rpS6, and increased expression of SM1 in arterioles from old rats. Thus age-induced contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles and emergence of a secretory smooth muscle phenotype may contribute to impaired coronary blood flow responses, but arteriolar contractile responsiveness and a younger smooth muscle phenotype can be restored with late-life exercise training.
NEW & NOTEWORTHY Aging impairs contractile function of coronary arterioles and induces a shift of the vascular smooth muscle toward a proliferative, noncontractile phenotype. Late-life exercise training reverses contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles and restores a young phenotype to the vascular smooth muscle.

Impact of Spaceflight and Artificial Gravity on the Mouse Retina: Biochemical and Proteomic Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6165321/,"Astronauts are reported to have experienced some impairment in visual acuity during their mission on the International Space Station (ISS) and after they returned to Earth. There is emerging evidence that changes in vision may involve alterations in ocular structure and function. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles and oxidative stress-associated apoptosis were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Nine-week-old male C57BL/6 mice ( n = 12) were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on a SpaceX rocket to the ISS for a 35-day mission. The animals were housed in the mouse Habitat Cage Unit (HCU) in the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) “Kibo” facility on the ISS. The flight mice lived either under an ambient microgravity condition (µg) or in a centrifugal habitat unit that produced 1 g artificial gravity (µg + 1 g ). Habitat control (HC) and vivarium control mice lived on Earth in HCUs or normal vivarium cages, respectively. Quantitative assessment of ocular tissue demonstrated that the µg group induced significant apoptosis in the retina vascular endothelial cells compared to all other groups ( p < 0.05) that was 64% greater than that in the HC group. Proteomic analysis showed that many key pathways responsible for cell death, cell repair, inflammation, and metabolic stress were significantly altered in µg mice compared to HC animals. Additionally, there were more significant changes in regulated protein expression in the µg group relative to that in the µg + 1 g group. These data provide evidence that spaceflight induces retinal apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells and changes in retinal protein expression related to cellular structure, immune response and metabolic function, and that artificial gravity (AG) provides some protection against these changes. These retinal cellular responses may affect blood–retinal barrier (BRB) integrity, visual acuity, and impact the potential risk of developing late retinal degeneration.

Simulated microgravity induces regionally distinct neurovascular and structural remodeling of skeletal muscle and cutaneous arteries in the rat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7339929/,"Introduction : Mechanical forces and sympathetic influences are key determinants of vascular structure and function. This study tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading (HU) exerts diverse effects on forelimb and hindlimb small arteries of rats in functionally different regions of the skeletal muscle and skin.
Methods : Male Wistar rats were subjected to HU for 2 weeks, then skeletal muscle arteries (deep brachial and sural) and skin arteries (median and saphenous) were examined in vitro using wire myography or isobaric perfusion and glyoxylic acid staining.
Results : HU increased lumen diameter of both forelimb arteries but decreased diameter of the sural artery; the saphenous artery diameter was not affected. Following HU, maximal contractile responses to noradrenaline and serotonin increased in the forelimb but decreased in the hindlimb skeletal muscle feed arteries with no change in skin arteries; all region-specific alterations persisted after endothelium removal. HU increased the sensitivity to vasoconstrictors in the saphenous artery but not in the sural artery. In the saphenous artery, initially high sympathetic innervation density was reduced by HU, sparse innervation in the sural artery was not affected. Electrical stimulation of periarterial sympathetic nerves in isobarically perfused segments of the saphenous artery demonstrated a two-fold decrease of the contractile responses in HU rats compared to that of controls.
Conclusion : HU induces contrasting structural and functional adaptations in forelimb and hindlimb skeletal muscle arteries. Additionally, HU had diverse effects in two hindlimb vascular regions. Hyper-sensitivity of the saphenous artery to vasoconstrictors appears to result from the shortage of trophic sympathetic influence. Importantly, HU impaired sympathetically induced arterial vasoconstriction, consistent with the decreased sympathetic constrictor response in humans following space flight.

Spaceflight decelerates the epigenetic clock orchestrated with a global alteration in DNA methylome and transcriptome in the mouse retina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8220224/,"Astronauts exhibit an assortment of clinical abnormalities in their eyes during long-duration spaceflight. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight induces epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming in the retina or alters the epigenetic clock. The mice were flown for 37 days in animal enclosure modules on the International Space Station; ground-based control animals were maintained under similar housing conditions. Mouse retinas were isolated and both DNA methylome and transcriptome were determined by deep sequencing. We found that a large number of genes were differentially methylated with spaceflight, whereas there were fewer differentially expressed genes at the transcriptome level. Several biological pathways involved in retinal diseases such as macular degeneration were significantly altered. Our results indicated that spaceflight decelerated the retinal epigenetic clock.

Development of otolith receptors in Japanese quail.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2910419/,"The present study examined the morphological development of the otolith vestibular receptors in quail. Here we describe epithelial growth, hair cell density, stereocilia polarization, and afferent nerve innervation during development. The otolith maculae epithelial areas increased exponentially throughout embryonic development reaching asymptotic values near post-hatch day P7. Increases in hair cell density were dependent upon macular location; striolar hair cells developed first followed by hair cells in extrastriola regions. Stereocilia polarization was initiated early, with defining reversal zones forming at E8. Less than half of all immature hair cells observed had non-polarized internal kinocilia with the remaining exhibiting planar polarity. Immunohistochemistry and neural tracing techniques were employed to examine the shape and location of the striolar regions. Initial innervation of the maculae was by small fibers with terminal growth cones at E6, followed by collateral branches with apparent bouton terminals at E8. Calyceal terminal formation began at E10, however no mature calyces were observed until E12, when all fibers appeared to be dimorphs. Calyx afferents innervating only type I hair cells did not develop until E14. Finally, the topographic organization of afferent macular innervation in the adult quail utricle was quantified. Calyx and dimorph afferents were primarily confined to the striolar regions, while bouton fibers were located in the extrastriola and type II band. Calyx fibers were the least complex, followed by dimorph units. Bouton fibers had large innervation fields, with arborous branches and many terminal boutons.

Spatial and temporal characteristics of vestibular convergence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166430/,"In all species studied, afferents from semicircular canals and otolith organs converge on central neurons in the brainstem. However, the spatial and temporal relationships between converging inputs and how these contribute to vestibular behaviors is not well understood. In the current study, we used discrete rotational and translational motion stimuli to characterize canal- and otolith-driven response components of convergent non-eye movement (NEM) neurons in the vestibular nuclear complex of alert pigeons. When compared to afferent responses, convergent canal signals had similar gain and phase ranges but exhibited greater spatial variability in their axes of preferred rotation. Convergent otolith signals also had similar mean gain and phase values to the afferent population but were spatially well-matched with the corresponding canal signals, cell-by-cell. However, neither response component alone nor a simple linear combination of these components was sufficient to predict actual net responses during combined canal-otolith stimulation. We discuss these findings in the context of previous studies of pigeon vestibular behaviors, and we compare our findings to similar studies in other species.

Bone remodeling is regulated by inner ear vestibular signals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6615562/,"Bone remodeling of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule is highly restricted and tightly controlled by the osteoprotegerin (OPG) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK) system. In these bony structures, a pathological decrease in OPG expression stimulates osteoclast differentiation and excessive resorption followed by accrual of sclerotic bone, ultimately resulting in the development of otosclerosis, a leading cause of deafness in adults. Understanding the signaling pathways involved in maintaining OPG expression in the ear would shed light on the pathophysiology of otosclerosis and other ear bone-related diseases. We and others previously demonstrated that Ca 2+ signaling through the L-type Ca V 1.2 Ca 2+ channel positively regulates OPG expression and secretion in long bone osteoblasts and their precursor cells in vitro and in vivo. Whether Ca V 1.2 regulates OPG expression in ear bones has not been investigated. We drove expression of a gain-of-function Ca V 1.2 mutant channel (Ca V 1.2 TS ) using Col2a1-Cre, which we found to target osteochondral/osteoblast progenitors in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule. Col2a1-Cre;Ca V 1.2 TS mice displayed osteopetrosis of these bones shown by μCT 3D reconstruction, histological analysis, and lack of bone sculpting, findings similar to phenotypes seen in mice with an osteoclast defect. Consistent with those observations, we found that Col2a1-Cre;Ca V 1.2 TS mutant mice showed reduced osteoclasts in the otic capsule, upregulated mRNA expression of Opg and Opg/Rankl ratio, and increased mRNA expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes in the otic capsule, suggesting both an anti-catabolic and anabolic effect of Ca V 1.2 TS mutant channel contributed to the observed morphological changes of the ear bones. Further, we found that Col2a1-Cre;Ca V 1.2 TS mice experienced hearing loss and displayed defects of body balance in behavior tests, confirming that the Ca V 1.2-dependent Ca 2+ influx affects bone structure in the ear and consequent hearing and vestibular functions. Together, these data support our hypothesis that Ca 2+ influx through Ca V 1.2 TS promotes OPG expression from osteoblasts, thereby affecting bone modeling/remodeling in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule. These data provide insight into potential pathological mechanisms underlying perturbed OPG expression and otosclerosis.

Simulated Microgravity Enhances Oligodendrocyte Mitochondrial Function and Lipid Metabolism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324008/,"The primary energy sources of mammalian cells are proteins, fats and sugars that are processed by well-known biochemical mechanisms that have been discovered and studied in 1G (terrestrial gravity). Here we sought to determine how simulated microgravity (sim-μG) impacts both energy and lipid metabolism in oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. We report increased mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis 24 hours after exposure to sim-μG. Moreover, examination of the secretome after three days exposure of OLs to sim-μG confirmed increased the Krebs cycle ( Krebs & Weitzman et al., 1987 ), flux in sim-μG. The secretome study also revealed a significant increase in the synthesis of fatty acids and complex lipids such as, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-GPC (5.67), lysolipids like 1-oleoyl-GPE (4.48) were also increased by microgravity. Although longer chain lipids were not observed in this study, it is possible that at longer time points OLs would have continued moving forward toward the synthesis of lipids that constitute myelin. For centuries, basic developmental biology research has been the pillar to an array of discoveries that have led to clinical applications; we believe that studies using microgravity will open new avenues to our understanding of the brain in health and disease, in particular, to the discovery of new molecules and mechanisms impossible to unveil while in 1G.

Human Neural Stem Cells Flown into Space Proliferate and Generate Young Neurons,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8412175/,"Here we demonstrate that human neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferate while in space and they express specific NSC markers after being in space. NSCs displayed both higher oxygen consumption and glycolysis than ground controls. These cells also kept their ability to become young neurons. Electrophysiological recordings of space NSC-derived neurons showed immature cell membrane properties characterized by small capacitance and very high input resistance. Current injections elicited only an incipient action potential. No spontaneous synaptic events could be detected, suggesting their immature status even though most recorded cells displayed complex morphology and numerous cell processes.

Space Microgravity Alters Neural Stem Cell Division: Implications for Brain Cancer Research on Earth and in Space,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9699585/,"Considering the imminence of long-term space travel, it is necessary to investigate the impact of space microgravity (SPC-µG) in order to determine if this environment has consequences on the astronauts’ health, in particular, neural and cognitive functions. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the basis for the regeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) cell populations and learning how weightlessness impacts NSCs in health and disease provides a critical tool for the potential mitigation of specific mechanisms leading to neurological disorders. In previous studies, we found that exposure to SPC-µG resulted in enhanced proliferation, a shortened cell cycle, and a larger cell diameter of NSCs compared to control cells. Here, we report the frequent occurrence of abnormal cell division (ACD) including incomplete cell division (ICD), where cytokinesis is not successfully completed, and multi-daughter cell division (MDCD) of NSCs following SPC-µG as well as secretome exposure compared to ground control (1G) NSCs. These findings provide new insights into the potential health implications of space travel and have far-reaching implications for understanding the mechanisms leading to the deleterious effects of long-term space travel as well as potential carcinogenic susceptibility. Knowledge of these mechanisms could help to develop preventive or corrective measures for successful long-term SPC-µG exposure.

Oligodendrocyte Progenitors Display Enhanced Proliferation and Autophagy after Space Flight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9953055/,"Intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) are some of the consequences of long-term space missions. Here we examined the behavior of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) after space flight using time-lapse microscopy. We show that most OLPs divided more than ground control (GC) counterparts did. Nonetheless, a subpopulation of OLPs flown to space presented a significant increase in autophagic cell death. Examination of the proteomic profile of the secretome of space flown OLPs (SPC-OLPs) revealed that the stress protein heat shock protein-90 beta “HSP-90β” was the 5 th most enriched (6.8 times) and the secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine “SPARC” was the 7 th most enriched (5.2 times), with respect to ground control cells. SPARC induces endoplasmic reticulum stress, which leads to autophagy. Given the roles and importance of these two proteins in mammalian cells’ metabolism, their upregulation may hold the key to modulating cell proliferation and autophagy, in order to mitigate ICP and VIIP during and after space missions.

Metabolomics profile of the secretome of space-flown oligodendrocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10528075/,"Intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) are some of the sequels of long-term space missions. Here we sought to determine how space microgravity (µG) impacts the metabolomics profile of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs), the myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system. We report increased glutamate and energy metabolism while the OLPs were in space for 26 days. We also show that after space flight, OLPs (SPC OLPs) display significantly increased mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. These data are in agreement with our previous work using simulated microgravity. In addition, our global metabolomics approach allowed for the discovery of endogenous metabolites secreted by OLPs while in space that are significantly modulated by microgravity. Our results provide, for the first time, relevant information about the energetic state of OLPs while in space and after space flight. The functional and molecular relevance of these specific pathways are promising targets for therapeutic intervention for humans in long-term space missions to the moon, Mars and beyond.

Metabolomic profiling of the secretome from human neural stem cells flown into space.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10813126/,"The change in gravitational force has a significant effect on biological tissues and the entire organism. As with any alteration in the environment, microgravity (µG) produces modifications in the system inducing adaptation to the new condition. In this study, we analyzed the effect of µG on neural stem cells (NSCs) following a space flight to the International Space Station (ISS). After 3 days in space, analysis of the metabolome in culture medium revealed increased glycolysis with augmented pyruvate and glycerate levels, and activated catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and glutamine. NSCs flown into space (SPC-NSCs) also showed increased synthesis of NADH and formation of polyamine spermidine when compared to ground controls (GC-NSCs). Overall, the space environment appears to increase energy demands in response to the µG setting.

"Strategies, research priorities, and challenges for the exploration of space beyond low-Earth orbit",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10390562/,"Space exploration objectives will soon move from low Earth orbit to distant destinations like Moon and Mars. The present work provides an up-to-date roadmap that identifies critical research gaps related to human behavior and performance in altered gravity and space. The roadmap summarizes (1) key neurobehavioral challenges associated with spaceflight, (2) the need to consider sex as a biological variable, (3) the use of integrative omics technologies to elucidate mechanisms underlying changes in the brain and behavior, and (4) the importance of understanding the neural representation of gravity throughout the brain and its multisensory processing. We then highlight the need for a variety of target-specific countermeasures, and a personalized administration schedule as two critical strategies for mitigating potentially adverse effects of spaceflight on the central nervous system and performance. We conclude with a summary of key priorities for the roadmaps of current and future space programs and stress the importance of new collaborative strategies across agencies and researchers for fostering an integrative cross- and transdisciplinary approach from cells, molecules to neural circuits and cognitive performance. Finally, we highlight that space research in neurocognitive science goes beyond monitoring and mitigating risks in astronauts but could also have significant benefits for the population on Earth.

Spaceflight Induces Specific Alterations in the Proteomes of Arabidopsis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4290804/,"Life in spaceflight demonstrates remarkable acclimation processes within the specialized habitats of vehicles subjected to the myriad of unique environmental issues associated with orbital trajectories. To examine the response processes that occur in plants in space, leaves and roots from Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) seedlings from three GFP reporter lines that were grown from seed for 12 days on the International Space Station and preserved on orbit in RNAlater were returned to Earth and analyzed by using iTRAQ broad-scale proteomics procedures. Using stringent criteria, we identified over 1500 proteins, which included 1167 leaf proteins and 1150 root proteins we were able to accurately quantify. Quantification revealed 256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins that showed statistically significant differential abundance in the spaceflight samples compared to ground controls, with few proteins differentially regulated in common between leaves and roots. This indicates that there are measurable proteomics responses to spaceflight and that the responses are organ-specific. These proteomics data were compared with transcriptome data from similar spaceflight samples, showing that there is a positive but limited relationship between transcriptome and proteome regulation of the overall spaceflight responses of plants.

The effect of spaceflight on the gravity-sensing auxin gradient of roots: GFP reporter gene microscopy on orbit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515520/,"Our primary aim was to determine whether gravity has a direct role in establishing the auxin-mediated gravity-sensing system in primary roots. Major plant architectures have long been thought to be guided by gravity, including the directional growth of the primary root via auxin gradients that are then disturbed when roots deviate from the vertical as a gravity sensor. However, experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) now allow physical clarity with regard to any assumptions regarding the role of gravity in establishing fundamental root auxin distributions. We examined the spaceflight green fluorescent protein (GFP)-reporter gene expression in roots of transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana : pDR5r::GFP, pTAA1::TAA1–GFP, pSCR::SCR–GFP to monitor auxin and pARR5::GFP to monitor cytokinin. Plants on the ISS were imaged live with the Light Microscopy Module (LMM), and compared with control plants imaged on the ground. Preserved spaceflight and ground control plants were examined post flight with confocal microscopy. Plants on orbit, growing in the absence of any physical reference to the terrestrial gravity vector, displayed typically “vertical” distribution of auxin in the primary root. This confirms that the establishment of the auxin-gradient system, the primary guide for gravity signaling in the root, is gravity independent. The cytokinin distribution in the root tip differs between spaceflight and the ground controls, suggesting spaceflight-induced features of root growth may be cytokinin related. The distribution of auxin in the gravity-sensing portion of the root is not dependent on gravity. Spaceflight appears benign to auxin and its role in the development of the primary root tip, whereas spaceflight may influence cytokinin-associated processes.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-npjmicrogr.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5dc5/5515520/b27932f2c28d/npjmgrav201523-f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5dc5/5515520/15c92199d85f/npjmgrav201523-f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5dc5/5515520/bc671a9ad41b/npjmgrav201523-f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5dc5/5515520/2be93f8acf4f/npjmgrav201523-f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5dc5/5515520/d9b45b0ae1c4/npjmgrav201523-f5.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

"Data for characterization of SALK_084889, a T-DNA insertion line of Arabidopsis thaliana",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5470433/,"In this article we report the identification of T-DNA (transfer DNA) insertion sites within two different gene regions in the genome of an Arabidopsis mutant line, SALK_084889. The T-DNA positions are in the 3′ UTR (untranslated region) of DREB2A (Dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 2A) ( AT5G05410 ) and promoter of LOX1 (Lipoxygenase 1) ( AT1G55020 ) as determined by DNA-PCR and sanger sequencing. The expression levels of DREB2A and LOX1 were also analyzed using quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) in SALK_084889 and wild type Arabidopsis (Col, Columbia). Further, the comparison of drought and heat tolerance between Col and SALK_084889 were conducted by stress treatments. The present data indicate that in SALK_084889, the expression of DREB2A is not downregulated under normal growth conditions but can be affected only in roots under drought treatment, while LOX1 is significantly downregulated in both roots and shoots under all tested conditions. These data are original and have not been published elsewhere.

T-DNA insertion lines provide important resource for genetic analysis based on mutagenesis in plant research. SALK lines are the most widely used T-DNA insertion lines for the model plant Arabidopsis. Accurate assessment of insertions is critical for understanding the value of the insertion lines.
SALK_084889 is annotated as a T-DNA insertion line of DREB2A , a key regulator of drought and heat response in Arabidopsis. We characterized DREB2A expression in normal and drought conditions in this line, which is relevant for analysis of DREB2A mutants in further investigation.
The LOX1 gene plays a critical role in multiple bioprocesses associated with lipid peroxidation. Our data identified a T-DNA insertion within promoter of LOX1 and showed the knock-out expression of LOX1 in SALK_084889.

Genetic dissection of the Arabidopsis spaceflight transcriptome: Are some responses dispensable for the physiological adaptation of plants to spaceflight?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5491145/,"Experimentation on the International Space Station has reached the stage where repeated and nuanced transcriptome studies are beginning to illuminate the structural and metabolic differences between plants grown in space compared to plants on the Earth. Genes that are important in establishing the spaceflight responses are being identified, their roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are actually required for survival has yet to be posed, and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses in the root tips of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, phyD plants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. These differential genotypic responses suggest that genetic manipulation could further reduce, or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8847/5491145/f0fa937058aa/pone.0180186.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8847/5491145/f00d4347f43e/pone.0180186.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8847/5491145/006a7ae02932/pone.0180186.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8847/5491145/aaec69172952/pone.0180186.g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8847/5491145/77a86d29e019/pone.0180186.g005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8847/5491145/c5f1fc6b9b28/pone.0180186.g006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8847/5491145/71e9f0bb64f3/pone.0180186.g007.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

In the heterozygous T-DNA allele the expression levels of AT1G05290 were compared to wild type Arabidopsis (Col-0, Columbia). Further analyses revealed an aberrant silique phenotype found in the heterozygous SALK_063500 plants that is attributed to the reduced rate of pollen tube germination.

Spaceflight-induced alternative splicing during seedling development in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6447593/,"Plants grown in spaceflight experience novel environmental signals, including those associated with microgravity and ionizing radiation. Spaceflight triggers a response involving transcriptional re-programming and altered cell morphology, though many aspects of this response remain uncharacterized. We analyzed the spaceflight-induced transcriptome with a focus on genes that undergo alternative splicing to examine differential splicing associated with spaceflight—an unstudied characteristic of the molecular response to spaceflight exposure. RNA sequence data obtained during the APEX03 spaceflight experiment that was collected from two Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes at two seedling stages grown onboard the International Space Station, or as ground controls at Kennedy Space Center, were re-examined to detect alternative splicing differences induced by spaceflight. Presence/absence variation analysis was used to identify putative expression-level differences in alternatively spliced isoforms between spaceflight and ground controls and was followed by analysis of significant differential alternative splicing. This study provides the first evidence of a role for alternative splicing in the molecular processes of physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-npjmicrogr.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4444/6447593/f5032c0d9591/41526_2019_70_Fig1_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4444/6447593/0cf73d05e012/41526_2019_70_Fig2_HTML.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
The Plant Health Monitoring System of the EDEN ISS Space Greenhouse in Antarctica during the 2018 experiment phase,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7264257/,"The EDEN ISS greenhouse is a space-analog test facility near the German Neumayer III station in Antarctica. The facility is part of the project of the same name and was designed and built starting from March 2015 and eventually deployed in Antarctica in January 2018. The nominal operation of the greenhouse started on February 7th and continued until the 20th of November. The purpose of the facility is to enable multidisciplinary research on topics related to future plant cultivation on human space exploration missions. Research on food quality and safety, plant health monitoring, microbiology, system validation, human factors and horticultural sciences was conducted. Part of the latter is the determination of the biomass production of the different crops. The data on this topic is presented in this paper. During the first season 26 different crops were grown on the 12.5 m 2 cultivation area of the greenhouse. A large number of crops were grown continuously throughout the 9 months of operation, but there were also crops that were only grown a few times for test purposes. The focus of this season was on growing lettuce, leafy greens and fresh vegetables. In total more than 268 kg of edible biomass was produced by the EDEN ISS greenhouse facility in 2018. Most of the harvest was cucumbers (67 kg), lettuces (56 kg), leafy greens (49 kg), and tomatoes (50 kg) complemented with smaller amounts of herbs (12 kg), radish (8 kg), and kohlrabi (19 kg). The environmental set points for the crops were 330–600 μmol/(m 2* s) LED light, 21°C, ∼65% relative humidity, 1000 ppm and the photoperiod was 17 h per day. The overall yearly productivity of the EDEN ISS greenhouse in 2018 was 27.4 kg/m 2 , which is equal to 0.075 kg/(m 2* d). This paper shows in detail the data on edible and inedible biomass production of each crop grown in the EDEN ISS greenhouse in Antarctica during the 2018 season.

Root skewing-associated genes impact the spaceflight response of Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7064724/,"The observation that plant roots skew in microgravity recently refuted the long-held conviction that skewing was a gravity-dependent phenomenon. Further, spaceflight root skewing suggests that specific root morphologies and cell wall remodeling systems may be important aspects of spaceflight physiological adaptation. However, connections between skewing, cell wall modification and spaceflight physiology are currently based on inferences rather than direct tests. Therefore, the Advanced Plant Experiments-03-2 (APEX-03-2) spaceflight study was designed to elucidate the contribution of two skewing- and cell wall-associated genes in Arabidopsis to root behavior and gene expression patterns in spaceflight, to assess whether interruptions of different skewing pathways affect the overall spaceflight-associated process. SPIRAL1 is a skewing-related protein implicated in directional cell expansion, and functions by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics. SKU5 is skewing-related glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein of the plasma membrane and cell wall implicated in stress response signaling. These two genes function in different cellular pathways that affect skewing on the Earth, and enable a test of the relevance of skewing pathways to spaceflight physiological adaptation. In this study, both sku5 and spr1 mutants showed different skewing behavior and markedly different patterns of gene expression in the spaceflight environment. The spr1 mutant showed fewer differentially expressed genes than its Col-0 wild-type, whereas sku5 showed considerably more than its WS wild-type. Developmental age played a substantial role in spaceflight acclimation in all genotypes, but particularly in sku5 plants, where spaceflight 4d seedlings had almost 10-times as many highly differentially expressed genes as the 8d seedlings. These differences demonstrated that the two skewing pathways represented by SKU5 and SPR1 have unique and opposite contributions to physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The spr1 response is less intense than wild type, suggesting that the loss of SPR1 positively impacts spaceflight adaptation. Conversely, the intensity of the sku5 responses suggests that the loss of SKU5 initiates a much more complex, deeper and more stress related response to spaceflight. This suggests that proper SKU5 function is important to spaceflight adaptation.

Articular cartilage and sternal fibrocartilage respond differently to extended microgravity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6379395/,"The effects of spaceflight on cartilaginous structure are largely unknown. To address this deficiency, articular cartilage (AC) and sternal cartilage (SC) from mice exposed to 30 days of microgravity on the BION-M1 craft were investigated for pathological changes. The flight AC showed some evidence of degradation at the tissue level with loss of proteoglycan staining and a reduction in mRNA expression of mechano-responsive and structural cartilage matrix proteins compared to non-flight controls. These data suggest that degradative changes are underway in the AC extracellular matrix exposed to microgravity. In contrast, there was no evidence of cartilage breakdown in SC flight samples and the gene expression profile was distinct from that of AC with a reduction in metalloproteinase gene transcription. Since the two cartilages respond differently to microgravity we propose that each is tuned to the biomechanical environments in which they are normally maintained. That is, the differences between magnitude of normal terrestrial loading and the unloading of microgravity dictates the tissue response. Weight-bearing articular cartilage, but not minimally loaded sternal fibrocartilage, is negatively affected by the unloading of microgravity.

One such stressor, microgravity, has been shown to alter host-microbe interactions at the genetic and physiological levels. Recent sequencing of the microbiomes associated with plants and animals have shown that these interactions are essential for maintaining host health through the regulation of several metabolic and immune responses. Disruptions to various environmental parameters or community characteristics may impact the resiliency of the microbiome, thus potentially driving host-microbe associations towards disease. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of host-microbe interactions in microgravity and assess the impact of this unique environmental stress on the normal physiological and genetic responses of both pathogenic and mutualistic associations. As humans move beyond our biosphere and undergo longer duration space flights, it will be essential to more fully understand microbial fitness in microgravity conditions in order to maintain a healthy homeostasis between humans, plants and their respective microbiomes.

Symbiotic organs shaped by distinct modes of genome evolution in cephalopods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6386654/,"Microbes have been critical drivers of evolutionary innovation in animals. To understand the processes that influence the origin of specialized symbiotic organs, we report the sequencing and analysis of the genome of Euprymna scolopes , a model cephalopod with richly characterized host–microbe interactions. We identified large-scale genomic reorganization shared between E. scolopes and Octopus bimaculoides and posit that this reorganization has contributed to the evolution of cephalopod complexity. To reveal genomic signatures of host–symbiont interactions, we focused on two specialized organs of E. scolopes : the light organ, which harbors a monoculture of Vibrio fischeri , and the accessory nidamental gland (ANG), a reproductive organ containing a bacterial consortium. Our findings suggest that the two symbiotic organs within E. scolopes originated by different evolutionary mechanisms. Transcripts expressed in these microbe-associated tissues displayed their own unique signatures in both coding sequences and the surrounding regulatory regions. Compared with other tissues, the light organ showed an abundance of genes associated with immunity and mediating light, whereas the ANG was enriched in orphan genes known only from E. scolopes . Together, these analyses provide evidence for different patterns of genomic evolution of symbiotic organs within a single host.
Numerous organisms have specialized organs to house their microbiota, yet the evolutionary processes underlying the origin of these tissues are not well understood ( 1 – 4 ). The Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes , is a tractable animal model that has proven invaluable for interrogating symbiotic relationships and revealing common mechanisms by which successful colonization of animal epithelia by bacteria is established and maintained ( Fig. 1 A ) ( 5 ). In the light organ (LO) of E. scolopes , a monospecific association with the bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri provides camouflage for the host and triggers a coordinated developmental remodeling of the surrounding epithelial tissues ( 6 ). Additionally, E. scolopes harbors a complex microbial consortium in the accessory nidamental gland (ANG), a component of the female reproductive system of many squids and cuttlefish that is hypothesized to play a role in egg defense ( Fig. 1 B ) ( 7 , 8 ). Octopus bimaculoides , the other cephalopod for which a genome has been reported to date, has neither a light organ nor an ANG making it an ideal organism for comparison ( Fig. 1 C ). Therefore, to define elements of genome structure and function that are critical for symbiosis and the evolution of cephalopods, we sequenced and characterized the E. scolopes genome, the first example from the superorder Decapodiformes.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-pnas.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ff6c/6386654/b5217630a0b2/pnas.1817322116fig01.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ff6c/6386654/60c422b8999c/pnas.1817322116fig02.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ff6c/6386654/74a443be0a72/pnas.1817322116fig03.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ff6c/6386654/2b9f1ddd85e5/pnas.1817322116fig04.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Modeled microgravity alters lipopolysaccharide and outer membrane vesicle production of the beneficial symbiont Vibrio fischeri,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7940393/,"Reduced gravity, or microgravity, can have a pronounced impact on the physiology of animals, but the effects on their associated microbiomes are not well understood. Here, the impact of modeled microgravity on the shedding of Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by the symbiotic bacterium Vibrio fischeri was examined using high-aspect ratio vessels. LPS from V. fischeri is known to induce developmental apoptosis within its symbiotic tissues, which is accelerated under modeled microgravity conditions. In this study, we provide evidence that exposure to modeled microgravity increases the amount of LPS released by the bacterial symbiont in vitro. The higher rates of shedding under modeled microgravity conditions are associated with increased production of outer-membrane vesicles (OMV), which has been previously correlated to flagellar motility. Mutants of V. fischeri defective in the production and rotation of their flagella show significant decreases in LPS shedding in all treatments, but levels of LPS are higher under modeled microgravity despite loss of motility. Modeled microgravity also appears to affect the outer-membrane integrity of V. fischeri , as cells incubated under modeled microgravity conditions are more susceptible to cell-membrane-disrupting agents. These results suggest that, like their animal hosts, the physiology of symbiotic microbes can be altered under microgravity-like conditions, which may have important implications for host health during spaceflight.

Emergence of novel cephalopod gene regulation and expression through large-scale genome reorganization,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9023564/,"Coleoid cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish, octopus) have the largest nervous system among invertebrates that together with many lineage-specific morphological traits enables complex behaviors. The genomic basis underlying these innovations remains unknown. Using comparative and functional genomics in the model squid Euprymna scolopes , we reveal the unique genomic, topological, and regulatory organization of cephalopod genomes. We show that coleoid cephalopod genomes have been extensively restructured compared to other animals, leading to the emergence of hundreds of tightly linked and evolutionary unique gene clusters (microsyntenies). Such novel microsyntenies correspond to topological compartments with a distinct regulatory structure and contribute to complex expression patterns. In particular, we identify a set of microsyntenies associated with cephalopod innovations (MACIs) broadly enriched in cephalopod nervous system expression. We posit that the emergence of MACIs was instrumental to cephalopod nervous system evolution and propose that microsyntenic profiling will be central to understanding cephalopod innovations.

In vitro generation of mechanically functional cartilage grafts based on adult human stem cells and 3D-woven poly(epsilon-caprolactone) scaffolds,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2824534/,"Three-dimensionally woven poly(ε-caprolactone)(PCL) scaffolds were combined with adult human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) to engineer mechanically functional cartilage constructs in vitro . The specific objectives were to: (i) produce PCL scaffolds with cartilage-like mechanical properties, (ii) demonstrate that hMSCs formed cartilage after 21-days of culture on PCL scaffolds, and (iii) study effects of scaffold structure (loosely vs. tightly woven), culture vessel (static dish vs. oscillating bioreactor), and medium composition (chondrogenic additives with or without serum). Aggregate moduli of 21-day constructs approached normal articular cartilage for tightly woven PCL cultured in bioreactors, were lower for tightly woven PCL cultured statically, and lowest for loosely woven PCL cultured statically ( p <0.05). Construct DNA, total collagen, and glyocosaminoglycans (GAG) increased in a manner dependent on time, culture vessel, and medium composition. Chondrogenesis was verified histologically by rounded cells within a hyaline-like matrix that immunostained for collagen type II but not type I. Bioreactors yielded constructs with higher collagen content ( p <0.05) and more homogenous matrix than static controls. Chondrogenic additives yielded constructs with higher GAG ( p <0.05) and earlier expression of collagen II mRNA if serum was not present in medium. These results show feasibility of functional cartilage tissue engineering from hMSC and 3D woven PCL scaffolds.

Chondrogenesis and mineralization during in vitro culture of human mesenchymal stem cells on three-dimensional woven scaffolds,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2991213/,"Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and three-dimensional (3D) woven poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds are promising tools for skeletal tissue engineering. We hypothesized that in vitro culture duration and medium additives can individually and interactively influence the structure, composition, mechanical, and molecular properties of engineered tissues based on hMSCs and 3D poly(ɛ-caprolactone). Bone marrow hMSCs were suspended in collagen gel, seeded on scaffolds, and cultured for 1, 21, or 45 days under chondrogenic and/or osteogenic conditions. Structure, composition, biomechanics, and gene expression were analyzed. In chondrogenic medium, cartilaginous tissue formed by day 21, and hypertrophic mineralization was observed in the newly formed extracellular matrix at the interface with underlying scaffold by day 45. Glycosaminoglycan, hydroxyproline, and calcium contents, and alkaline phosphatase activity depended on culture duration and medium additives, with significant interactive effects (all p < 0.0001). The 45-day constructs exhibited mechanical properties on the order of magnitude of native articular cartilage (aggregate, Young's, and shear moduli of 0.15, 0.12, and 0.033 MPa, respectively). Gene expression was characteristic of chondrogenesis and endochondral bone formation, with sequential regulation of Sox-9, collagen type II, aggrecan, core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfα1)/Runx2, bone sialoprotein, bone morphogenetic protein-2, and osteocalcin. In contrast, osteogenic medium produced limited osteogenesis. Long-term culture of hMSC on 3D scaffolds resulted in chondrogenesis and regional mineralization at the interface between soft, newly formed engineered cartilage, and stiffer underlying scaffold. These findings merit consideration when developing grafts for osteochondral defect repair.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-tea.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8062/2991213/f111dfc6d36d/fig-1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8062/2991213/c6d2ce63bcc5/fig-2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8062/2991213/e98b92b50c0e/fig-3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8062/2991213/0eadf6adaba4/fig-4.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

Spaceflight alters host-gut microbiota interactions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11362537/,"The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of spaceflight on mammals, inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy. Although these physiological responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiota interactions during spaceflight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota and host gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight using multiomics. Metagenomics revealed significant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis . Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. Host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression. These changes imply that interactions at the host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceflight pathology and that these interactions might critically influence human health and long-duration spaceflight feasibility.

Asparagine biosynthesis as a mechanism of increased host lethality induced by Serratia marcescens in simulated microgravity environments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9111996/,"While studies have shown an increase in pathogenicity in several microbes during spaceflight and after exposure to simulated microgravity, the mechanisms underlying these changes in phenotype are not understood across different pathogens, particularly in opportunistic pathogens. This study evaluates the mechanism for increased virulence of the opportunistic gram-negative bacterium, Serratia marcescens, in simulated microgravity. Low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) is used in ground-based studies to simulate the effects of microgravity as experienced in spaceflight. Our previous findings showed that there was a significant increase in mortality rates of the Drosophila melanogaster host when infected with either spaceflight or LSMMG treated S. marcescens . Here, we report that LSMMG increases asparagine uptake and synthesis in S. marcescens and that the increased host lethality induced by LSMMG bacteria grown in rich media can be recapitulated in minimal media by adding only aspartate and glutamine, the substrates of asparagine biosynthesis. Interestingly, increased bacterial growth rate alone is not sufficient to contribute to maximal host lethality, since the addition of aspartate to minimal media caused an LSMMG-specific increase in bacterial growth rate that is comparable to that induced by the combination of aspartate and glutamine, but this increase in growth does not cause an equivalent rate of host mortality. However, the addition of both aspartate and glutamine cause both an increase in host mortality and an overexpression of asparagine pathway genes in a LSMMG-dependent manner. We also report that L-asparaginase-mediated breakdown of asparagine is an effective countermeasure for the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG-treated bacteria. This investigation underscores the importance of the asparagine utilization pathway by helping uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie increased mortality rates of a model host infected with microgravity-treated S. marcescens and provides a potential mitigation strategy.

Comparative genomic analysis of Cohnella hashimotonis sp. nov. isolated from the International Space Station.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10308117/,"A single strain from the family Paenibacillaceae was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2018, as part of the Microbial Tracking mission series. This strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus Cohnella , designated as F6_2S_P_1 T . The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1 T strain places it in a clade with C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli , which were originally isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere environments. The closest 16S and gyrB matches to strain F6_2S_P_1 T are to C. rhizosphaerae with 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available Cohnella genomes places it as more closely related to C. ginsengisoli . Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to any described Cohnella species are <89 and <22%, respectively. The major fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1 T are anteiso-C 15:0 (51.7%), iso-C 16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C 15:0 (10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis , with the type strain F6_2S_P_1 T (=NRRL B-65657 T and DSMZ 115098 T ). Because no closely related Cohnella genomes were available, this study generated the whole-genome sequences (WGSs) of the type strains for C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli . Phylogenetic and pangenomic analysis reveals that F6_2S_P_1 T , C. rhizosphaerae , and C. ginsengisoli , along with two uncharacterized Cohnella strains, possess a shared set of 332 gene clusters which are not shared with any other WGS of Cohnella species, and form a distinct clade branching off from C. nanjingensis . Functional traits were predicted for the genomes of strain F6_2S_P_1 T and other members of this clade.

Biocontrol in built environments to reduce pathogen exposure and infection risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10848226/,"The microbiome of the built environment comprises bacterial, archaeal, fungal, and viral communities associated with human-made structures. Even though most of these microbes are benign, antibiotic-resistant pathogens can colonize and emerge indoors, creating infection risk through surface transmission or inhalation. Several studies have catalogued the microbial composition and ecology in different built environment types. These have informed in vitro studies that seek to replicate the physicochemical features that promote pathogenic survival and transmission, ultimately facilitating the development and validation of intervention techniques used to reduce pathogen accumulation. Such interventions include using Bacillus -based cleaning products on surfaces or integrating bacilli into printable materials. Though this work is in its infancy, early research suggests the potential to use microbial biocontrol to reduce hospital- and home-acquired multidrug-resistant infections. Although these techniques hold promise, there is an urgent need to better understand the microbial ecology of built environments and to determine how these biocontrol solutions alter species interactions. This review covers our current understanding of microbial ecology of the built environment and proposes strategies to translate that knowledge into effective biocontrol of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

Extracellular nucleotides elicit cytosolic free calcium oscillations in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3329368/,"Extracellular purine nucleotides appear capable of regulating plant development, defence and stress responses by acting in part as agonists of plasma membrane calcium channels. Factors stimulating ATP release include wounding, osmotic stress and elicitors. Here we show that exogenous abscisic acid and L-glutamate can also cause ATP accumulation around Arabidopsis thaliana roots. Release of ADP from root epidermis would trigger ionotropic receptor-like activity in the plasma membrane, resulting in transient elevation of cytosolic free calcium. Root epidermal protoplasts (expressing aequorin as a cytosolic free calcium reporter) can support an extracellular ADP-induced cytosolic calcium elevation in the presence of an extracellular reductant. This confirms that ADP could elicit calcium-based responses distinct to those of ATP, which have been shown previously to involve production of extracellular reactive oxygen species.

Extracellular purine nucleotides can regulate plant cell growth, stress responses, immunity and symbiotic events. 1 , 2 Their activity at the plasma membrane elicits increased production of nitric oxide (NO), activation of NADPH oxidases to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), and transient elevations of cytosolic free calcium ([Ca 2+ ] cyt ). 3 - 9 Although there are no equivalents to animal ionotropic or metabotropic purinoreceptor genes apparent in higher plant genomes, plant responses to extracellular purine nucleotides are sensitive to antagonists of animal purinoceptors. 1 , 10 - 12 Arabidopsis thaliana plasma membrane Ca 2+ channel activity was recently found to be activated rapidly by extracellular ADP, consistent with the presence of an ionotropic receptor. 13 Parallels with animal cells also extend to a conserved mechanism of ATP and ADP hydrolysis by extracellular apyrase, 14 plus release of ATP by exocytosis 15 and an ABC transporter. 16
ATP is released at plant wound and growth points, in response to touch, elicitors and hyperosmotic stress imposed by salts. 1 , 17 , 18 Here, wounding, hyperosmotic or sodicity stress resulted in distinct levels and time courses of ATP accumulation around excised roots of A. thaliana ( Fig. 1 ). Recovery of ATP levels to control values was evident at the 30 min time point after wounding but remained significantly elevated in response to abiotic stresses (30 min time point; NaCl, p < 0.001; sorbitol, p < 0.036, Student’s t-test). The stress response hormone abscisic acid (ABA) at 1 and 10 μM also promoted ATP accumulation around excised roots ( Fig. 2A ), albeit to a lower level. Accumulation above the ethanol control was significant for both concentrations at 10 and 15 min. Application of 10 μM ABA inhibits A. thaliana primary root growth, a response involving a plasma membrane NADPH oxidase and plasma membrane proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinase (PERK4). 19 , 20 PERK4 directs the activation of plasma membrane Ca 2+ influx channels. 20 As extracellular ATP activates root epidermal plasma membrane Ca 2+ influx channels via activation of an NADPH oxidase, it becomes feasible that ABA inhibition involves ATP release and sensing upstream of NADPH oxidases and PERKs, resulting in an inhibitory Ca 2+ influx. High [Ca 2+ ] cyt can act as a “brake” to root hair elongation and perhaps this may also hold for elongation of primary roots. 21 Production of ROS by NADPH oxidases also promotes root cell elongation by activating plasma membrane Ca 2+ channels. 22 Thus, the dose-dependent stimulation or inhibition of growth by extracellular ATP may be effected by the levels of ROS production and channel activation.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plantsig.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ebad/3329368/ab8f3f41391d/psb-6-1855-g1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ebad/3329368/3544f5d3a133/psb-6-1855-g2.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

"Salt stress-induced Ca2+ waves are associated with rapid, long-distance root-to-shoot signaling in plants.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4035928/,"Their sessile lifestyle means that plants have to be exquisitely sensitive to their environment, integrating many signals to appropriate developmental and physiological responses. Stimuli ranging from wounding and pathogen attack to the distribution of water and nutrients in the soil are frequently presented in a localized manner but responses are often elicited throughout the plant. Such systemic signaling is thought to operate through the redistribution of a host of chemical regulators including peptides, RNAs, ions, metabolites, and hormones. However, there are hints of a much more rapid communication network that has been proposed to involve signals ranging from action and system potentials to reactive oxygen species. We now show that plants also possess a rapid stress signaling system based on Ca 2+ waves that propagate through the plant at rates of up to ∼400 µm/s. In the case of local salt stress to the Arabidopsis thaliana root, Ca 2+ wave propagation is channeled through the cortex and endodermal cell layers and this movement is dependent on the vacuolar ion channel TPC1. We also provide evidence that the Ca 2+ wave/TPC1 system likely elicits systemic molecular responses in target organs and may contribute to whole-plant stress tolerance. These results suggest that, although plants do not have a nervous system, they do possess a sensory network that uses ion fluxes moving through defined cell types to rapidly transmit information between distant sites within the organism.
Plants are constantly tailoring their responses to current environmental conditions via a complex array of chemical regulators that integrate developmental and physiological programs across the plant body. Environmental stimuli are often highly localized in nature, but the subsequent plant response is often elicited throughout the entire organism. For example, soil is a highly heterogeneous environment and the root encounters stimuli that are presented in a patchy manner. Thus, factors including dry or waterlogged regions of the soil, variations in the osmotic environment, and stresses such as elevated levels of salt are all likely to be encountered locally by individual root tips, but the information may have to be acted on by the plant as a whole.
In animals, long-range signaling to integrate activities across the organism occurs through rapid ionic/membrane potential-driven signaling through the nervous system in addition to operating via long-distance chemical signaling. Plants have also been proposed to possess a rapid, systemic communication network, potentially mediated through signals ranging from changes in membrane potential/ion fluxes ( 1 – 3 ) and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) ( 4 , 5 ) to altered hydraulics in the vasculature ( 6 ). Even so, the molecular mechanisms behind rapid, systemic signaling in plants and whether such signals indeed carry regulatory information remains largely unknown. Suggestions that Ca 2+ channels play a role in signals that occlude sieve tube elements ( 7 ), or that mediate systemic electrical signaling ( 2 ) in response to remote wounding, highlight Ca 2+ -dependent signaling events as a strong candidate for mediating some of these long-range responses. Similarly, cooling of roots elicits Ca 2+ increases in the shoot within minutes ( 8 ), suggesting systemic signals can elicit Ca 2+ -dependent responses at distal sites within the plant. However, despite extensive characterization of Ca 2+ signals (reviewed in ref. 9 ), their roles in a possible plant-wide communication network remain poorly understood. Therefore, to visualize how Ca 2+ might act in local and systemic signaling, we generated Arabidopsis plants expressing the highly sensitive, GFP-based, cytoplasmic Ca 2+ sensor YCNano-65 ( 10 ). We observed that a range of abiotic stresses including H 2 O 2 , touch, NaCl, and cold shock triggered Ca 2+ increases at the point of application. However, NaCl also elicited a Ca 2+ increase that moved away from the point of stress application. Propagation of this Ca 2+ increase was associated with subsequent systemic changes in gene expression. We also report that this salt stress-induced long-distance Ca 2+ wave is dependent on the activity of the ion channel protein Two Pore Channel 1 (TPC1), which also appears to contribute to whole-plant stress tolerance.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-pnas.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2a2e/4035928/cb52e4b36e22/pnas.1319955111fig01.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2a2e/4035928/042d3e29a51b/pnas.1319955111fig02.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2a2e/4035928/26cfbf5cf7e6/pnas.1319955111fig03.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2a2e/4035928/1243fab1fed1/pnas.1319955111fig04.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2a2e/4035928/7ce40ec037e8/pnas.1319955111i1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2a2e/4035928/ef62acf8d303/pnas.1319955111uneq1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2a2e/4035928/4f97437f29e4/pnas.1319955111uneq2.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

Wortmannin-induced vacuole fusion enhances amyloplast dynamics in Arabidopsis zigzag1 hypocotyls.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5181587/,"Gravitropism in Arabidopsis shoots depends on the sedimentation of amyloplasts in the endodermis, and a complex interplay between the vacuole and F-actin. Gravity response is inhibited in zigzag-1 ( zig-1 ), a mutant allele of VTI11 , which encodes a SNARE protein involved in vacuole fusion. zig-1 seedlings have fragmented vacuoles that fuse after treatment with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and underscore a role of phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion. Using live-cell imaging with a vertical stage microscope, we determined that young endodermal cells below the apical hook that are smaller than 70 μm in length are the graviperceptive cells in dark-grown hypocotyls. This result was confirmed by local wortmannin application to the top of zig-1 hypocotyls, which enhanced shoot gravitropism in zig-1 mutants. Live-cell imaging of zig-1 hypocotyl endodermal cells indicated that amyloplasts are trapped between juxtaposed vacuoles and their movement is severely restricted. Wortmannin-induced fusion of vacuoles in zig-1 seedlings increased the formation of transvacuolar strands, enhanced amyloplast sedimentation and partially suppressed the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1 seedlings. Hypergravity conditions at 10 g were not sufficient to displace amyloplasts in zig-1 , suggesting the existence of a physical tether between the vacuole and amyloplasts. Our results overall suggest that vacuole membrane remodeling may be involved in regulating the association of vacuoles and amyloplasts during graviperception.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-jexbot.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/882b/5181587/ef050414e104/exbotj_erw418_f0001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/882b/5181587/a9a827a8415c/exbotj_erw418_f0002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/882b/5181587/d7119492a966/exbotj_erw418_f0003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/882b/5181587/248506f07a6e/exbotj_erw418_f0004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/882b/5181587/beafaf3875c9/exbotj_erw418_f0005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/882b/5181587/87ecdc878dca/exbotj_erw418_f0006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/882b/5181587/44ff136a1e04/exbotj_erw418_f0007.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/882b/5181587/d72923d950d1/exbotj_erw418_f0008.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/882b/5181587/f724395a6a97/exbotj_erw418_f0009.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
A ROS-assisted calcium wave dependent on AtRBOHD and TPC1 propagates the systemic response to salt stress in Arabidopsis roots,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4936552/,"Plants exhibit rapid, systemic signaling systems that allow them to coordinate physiological and developmental responses throughout the plant body, even to highly localized and quickly changing environmental stresses. The propagation of these signals is thought to include processes ranging from electrical and hydraulic networks to waves of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and cytoplasmic Ca 2+ traveling throughout the plant. For the Ca 2+ wave system, the involvement of the vacuolar ion channel TWO PORE CHANNEL1 (TPC1) has been reported. However, the precise role of this channel and the mechanism of cell-to-cell propagation of the wave have remained largely undefined. Here, we use the fire-diffuse-fire model to analyze the behavior of a Ca 2+ wave originating from Ca 2+ release involving the TPC1 channel in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ). We conclude that a Ca 2+ diffusion-dominated calcium-induced calcium-release mechanism is insufficient to explain the observed wave transmission speeds. The addition of a ROS -triggered element, however, is able to quantitatively reproduce the observed transmission characteristics. The treatment of roots with the ROS scavenger ascorbate and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyliodonium and analysis of Ca 2+ wave propagation in the Arabidopsis respiratory burst oxidase homolog D ( AtrbohD ) knockout background all led to reductions in Ca 2+ wave transmission speeds consistent with this model. Furthermore, imaging of extracellular ROS production revealed a systemic spread of ROS release that is dependent on both AtRBOHD and TPC1 . These results suggest that, in the root, plant systemic signaling is supported by a ROS -assisted calcium-induced calcium-release mechanism intimately involving ROS production by AtRBOHD and Ca 2+ release dependent on the vacuolar channel TPC1.
Plants possess a rapid systemic signaling network that enables whole-plant responses to localized stimuli. Examples include wounding ( Miller et al., 2009 ), pathogen attack ( Dempsey and Klessig, 2012 ), and osmotic shock ( Christmann et al., 2007 ). The system(s) involved in the plant-wide propagation of these signals has been proposed to be mediated by a diverse set of molecular regulators, including changes in membrane potential and ion fluxes ( Felle and Zimmermann, 2007 ; Zimmermann et al., 2009 ; Mousavi et al., 2013 ), hydraulics in the vasculature ( Christmann et al., 2007 ; Farmer et al., 2014 ), and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ; Miller et al., 2009 ). A novel addition to this suite of systemic signals was described by Choi et al. (2014) , in which a wave-like propagation of increased cytoplasmic Ca 2+ moved throughout the plant in response to localized salt stress. This signal propagated through the roots at a velocity of 396 ± 28 μm s −1 and induced the expression of a range of stress-response genes in the leaves. Unlike systemic signals described previously, this Ca 2+ wave preferentially propagates through the root cortical and endodermal cells rather than the vasculature ( Choi et al., 2014 ). Furthermore, the velocity of the signal is slower than the reported speed of 800 to 1,400 μm s −1 seen with the other proposed systemic signals, such as the ROS wave or electrical coupling ( Miller et al., 2009 ; Mousavi et al., 2013 ).
Choi et al. (2014) revealed that the Ca 2+ wave could be blocked by the application of pharmacological agents (La 3+ and Ruthenium Red) known to inhibit calcium-release pathways and that disruption of the TWO PORE CHANNEL1 ( TPC1 ) gene results in a substantial drop in wave speed ( Table I ). Furthermore, overexpression of TPC1 increased the speed of the wave by a factor of 1.7 ( Table I ). TPC1 also appears to be involved in systemic wound-related Ca 2+ increases ( Kiep et al., 2015 ), yet for many stress responses, whole-plant Ca 2+ signaling dynamics appear unchanged in TPC1 mutants ( Ranf et al., 2008 ).","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plntphys.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4907/4936552/213dd8a64ad2/PP_PP201600215R1_equ1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4907/4936552/8ea700389a99/PP_PP201600215R1_equ2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4907/4936552/4e1d83ce12a0/PP_PP201600215R1_equ3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4907/4936552/fcb84b6df352/PP_PP201600215R1_equ4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4907/4936552/33b3889c1345/PP_PP201600215R1_f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4907/4936552/511000bd3b67/PP_PP201600215R1_inf1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4907/4936552/511000bd3b67/PP_PP201600215R1_inf2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4907/4936552/d43742bcf98a/PP_PP201600215R1_f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4907/4936552/0a3f6acc912a/PP_PP201600215R1_f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4907/4936552/0a6bbbde1b34/PP_PP201600215R1_f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4907/4936552/7dbcd5037386/PP_PP201600215R1_equ5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4907/4936552/63bb42a5f9cf/PP_PP201600215R1_equ6.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4907/4936552/d9fd4688e37b/PP_PP201600215R1_equ7.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4907/4936552/e9404595c2c1/PP_PP201600215R1_equ8.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4907/4936552/a65cdeb1fafc/PP_PP201600215R1_f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4907/4936552/a050af1eb3d9/PP_PP201600215R1_f6.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4907/4936552/1c3911ca0745/PP_PP201600215R1_equ9.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4907/4936552/c1362629813c/PP_PP201600215R1_inf3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4907/4936552/a500b9010a32/PP_PP201600215R1_inf4.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
"ROS, calcium and electric signals: Key mediators of rapid systemic signaling in plants",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7610290/,"Systemic signaling and systemic acquired acclimation (SAA) are essential for plant survival during episodes of environmental stress. Recent studies highlighted a key role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling in mediating systemic responses and SAA during light stress in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) . These studies further identified the RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG D (RBOHD) protein as a key player in mediating rapid systemic ROS responses. Here, we report that tissue-specific expression of RBOHD in phloem or xylem parenchyma cells of the rbohD mutant restores systemic ROS signaling, systemic stress-response transcript expression, and SAA to a local treatment of light stress. We further demonstrate that RBOHD and RBOHF are both required for local and systemic ROS signaling at the vascular bundles of Arabidopsis. Taken together, our findings highlight a key role for RBOHD-driven ROS production at the vascular bundles of Arabidopsis in mediating light stress–induced systemic signaling and SAA. In addition, they suggest that the integration of ROS, calcium, electric, and hydraulic signals, during systemic signaling, occurs at the vascular bundles.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plntcell.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8c7b/7610290/a709114a0445/TPC_202000453DR1_fx1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8c7b/7610290/9cccbd9121db/TPC_202000453DR1_f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8c7b/7610290/8771ae0261e9/TPC_202000453DR1_f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8c7b/7610290/3ce9aa50e585/TPC_202000453DR1_f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8c7b/7610290/0b0ffc7f7141/TPC_202000453DR1_f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8c7b/7610290/1b2bf6d61bdd/TPC_202000453DR1_f5.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Real-time In Vivo Recording of Arabidopsis Calcium Signals During Insect Feeding Using a Fluorescent Biosensor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5614317/,"Calcium ions are predicted to be key signaling entities during biotic interactions, with calcium signaling forming an established part of the plant defense response to microbial elicitors and to wounding caused by chewing insects, eliciting systemic calcium signals in plants. However, the role of calcium in vivo during biotic stress is still unclear. This protocol describes the use of a genetically-encoded calcium sensor to detect calcium signals in plants during feeding by a hemipteran pest. Hemipterans such as aphids pierce a small number of cells with specialized, elongated sucking mouthparts, making them the ideal tool to study calcium dynamics when a plant is faced with a biotic stress, which is distinct from a wounding response. In addition, fluorescent biosensors are revolutionizing the measurement of signaling molecules in vivo in both animals and plants. Expressing a GFP-based calcium biosensor, GCaMP3, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana allows for the real-time imaging of plant calcium dynamics during insect feeding, with a high spatial and temporal resolution. A repeatable and robust assay has been developed using the fluorescence microscopy of detached GCaMP3 leaves, allowing for the continuous measurement of cytosolic calcium dynamics before, during, and after insect feeding. This reveals a highly-localized rapid calcium elevation around the aphid feeding site that occurs within a few minutes. The protocol can be adapted to other biotic stresses, such as additional insect species, while the use of Arabidopsis thaliana allows for the rapid generation of mutants to facilitate the molecular analysis of the phenomenon.

"Glutamate triggers long-distance, calcium-based plant defense signaling.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11850895/,"Animals rely on nervous systems to cope with environmental variability, whereas plants are characterized by lack of nervous system but still have evolved systemic communication systems through signaling molecules that trigger long-distance defense signaling events when encountered with environmental challenges. Here, our genetic screening of the previously constructed hairpin RNA-based Arabidopsis library identifies a glutathione (GSH)-deficient mutant that has high accumulation of glutamate (Glu), a previously defined wound signal essential for activating plant defense, but disharmoniously exhibits attenuation of defense signaling events. We further uncover GSH as a critical signaling molecule that relies on GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE 3.3 (GLR3.3) to trigger long-distance calcium-based defense signaling events in plants. Our findings offer new insights into highly sophisticated systemic defense systems evolved by plants to defend against herbivory and pathogen invasion.

Test of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome: A discovery environment to explore multiple plant biology spaceflight experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7076552/,"Recent advances in the routine access to space along with increasing opportunities to perform plant growth experiments on board the International Space Station have led to an ever-increasing body of transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data from plants experiencing spaceflight. These datasets hold great promise to help understand how plant biology reacts to this unique environment. However, analyses that mine across such expanses of data are often complex to implement, being impeded by the sheer number of potential comparisons that are possible. Complexities in how the output of these multiple parallel analyses can be presented to the researcher in an accessible and intuitive form provides further barriers to such research. Recent developments in computational systems biology have led to rapid advances in interactive data visualization environments designed to perform just such tasks. However, to date none of these tools have been tailored to the analysis of the broad-ranging plant biology spaceflight data. We have therefore developed the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) database ( https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast ) to address this gap in our capabilities. TOAST is a relational database that uses the Qlik database management software to link plant biology, spaceflight-related omics datasets, and their associated metadata. This environment helps visualize relationships across multiple levels of experiments in an easy to use gene-centric platform. TOAST draws on data from The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) GeneLab and other data repositories and also connects results to a suite of web-based analytical tools to facilitate further investigation of responses to spaceflight and related stresses. The TOAST graphical user interface allows for quick comparisons between plant spaceflight experiments using real-time, gene-specific queries, or by using functional gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, or other filtering systems to explore genetic networks of interest. Testing of the database shows that TOAST confirms patterns of gene expression already highlighted in the literature, such as revealing the modulation of oxidative stress-related responses across multiple plant spaceflight experiments. However, this data exploration environment can also drive new insights into patterns of spaceflight responsive gene expression. For example, TOAST analyses highlight changes to mitochondrial function as likely shared responses in many plant spaceflight experiments.

Tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumps regulate Ca2+ signals during pattern-triggered immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7414185/,"One of the major events of early plant immune responses is a rapid influx of Ca 2+ into the cytosol following pathogen recognition. Indeed, changes in cytosolic Ca 2+ are recognized as ubiquitous elements of cellular signaling networks and are thought to encode stimulus-specific information in their duration, amplitude, and frequency. Despite the wealth of observations showing that the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22 triggers Ca 2+ transients, there remain limited data defining the molecular identities of Ca 2+ transporters involved in shaping the cellular Ca 2+ dynamics during the triggering of the defense response network. However, the autoinhibited Ca 2+ -ATPase (ACA) pumps that act to expel Ca 2+ from the cytosol have been linked to these events, with knockouts in the vacuolar members of this family showing hypersensitive lesion-mimic phenotypes. We have therefore explored how the two tonoplast-localized pumps, ACA4 and ACA11, impact flg22-dependent Ca 2+ signaling and related defense responses. The double-knockout aca4/11 exhibited increased basal Ca 2+ levels and Ca 2+ signals of higher amplitude than wild-type plants. Both the aberrant Ca 2+ dynamics and associated defense-related phenotypes could be suppressed by growing the aca4/11 seedlings at elevated temperatures. Relocalization of ACA8 from its normal cellular locale of the plasma membrane to the tonoplast also suppressed the aca4/11 phenotypes but not when a catalytically inactive mutant was used. These observations indicate that regulation of vacuolar Ca 2+ sequestration is an integral component of plant immune signaling, but also that the action of tonoplast-localized Ca 2+ pumps does not require specific regulatory elements not found in plasma membrane-localized pumps.
Plant pathogens are ubiquitous in the environment and plants have evolved sensory systems to recognize their presence and trigger appropriate defense responses. One of the best characterized of these sensing networks is through plasma membrane localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). These PRRs bind pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs): That is, conserved molecular signals of pathogen presence, such as bacterial flagellin or fungal chitin. Upon PAMP-binding, the PRRs trigger an immune response termed pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) that can lead to the rapid development of both local and plant-wide defense (systemic acquired resistance) ( 1 ). The best-characterized of the PRRs is the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase flagellin-sensitive 2 (FLS2). This protein acts with a coreceptor, BAK1, and is responsible for recognizing bacterial flagellin (or minimally the flg22 peptide epitope within flagellin) ( 2 , 3 ) and triggers the signaling systems that lead to PTI.
Induction of these local and systemic responses involves the activation of myriad cellular signaling events at sites of pathogen perception, such as protein phosphorylation cascades, production of reactive oxygen species, anion fluxes, and apoplastic alkalization ( 1 , 4 – 6 ). One of these major hallmarks of early PTI responses is a rapid influx of Ca 2+ into the cytosol immediately after PAMP recognition. The subsequent change in cytosolic Ca 2+ level is then thought to play a role in triggering downstream responses ( 7 – 9 ). Indeed, changes in cytosolic Ca 2+ are recognized as ubiquitous elements of cellular signaling networks and are thought to encode stimulus-specific information in their duration, amplitude, and frequency: Their so-called “calcium signature” ( 10 ). Calcium signatures are determined by an interplay between Ca 2+ permeable channels, exchangers, and pumps ( 11 ). Two cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs 2 and 4) have emerged as likely key players in the Ca 2+ influx supporting the flg22-triggered signaling system under nonlimiting soil Ca 2+ levels ( 12 ). However, other channels are likely also involved as the cngc2/4 double mutant attenuates, but does not abolish, the flg22-induced Ca 2+ change. Similarly, although CNGC2 and -4 are thought to mediate Ca 2+ influx at the plasma membrane, whether release from internal Ca 2+ stores plays a major role in these signaling events remains to be fully characterized. Despite this important role for channels in generating such defense-related Ca 2+ signals, building evidence also suggests an important role for Ca 2+ efflux pumps in innate immune Ca 2+ signaling. In particular, mutants of P2B-type ATPases, or autoinhibited calcium ATPases (ACAs) ( 13 ), have been shown to exhibit aberrant patterns of PTI ( 14 , 15 ).
Thus, mutants in the Arabidopsis plasma membrane ACAs, ACA8 and ACA10, show impaired defense and attenuated flg22-induced Ca 2+ signals. Conversely, disruption of the tonoplast ACAs, ACA4 and ACA11, renders plants to be constitutively defense responsive, but whether these phenotypes are related to aberrations in Ca 2+ signaling remains unknown ( 14 ). We report that aca4/11 mutants show elevated basal Ca 2+ and an increased Ca 2+ signal in response to flg22. Elevated temperature is known to suppress defense-response phenotypes and growth at high temperatures rescued both the altered Ca 2+ dynamics and aberrant downstream pathogen responses. Furthermore, we report that the relocalization of a plasma membrane ACA (ACA8) to the tonoplast rescues the aca4/11 phenotype. These observations imply that tonoplast-localized Ca 2+ pumping is integral to maintaining homeostatic Ca 2+ levels and for the initiation of proper PTI responses. However, because the relocalized plasma membrane pump can rescue the tonoplast knockout phenotypes, any regulatory motifs specific to the tonoplast pumps may not be required to support normal Ca 2+ signaling in the flg22-triggered response network.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-pnas.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ecff/7414185/68862fcb98bd/pnas.2004183117fig01.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ecff/7414185/d4b79ffdefdd/pnas.2004183117fig02.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ecff/7414185/e4d801f75079/pnas.2004183117fig03.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ecff/7414185/3c1111ecd1f4/pnas.2004183117fig04.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ecff/7414185/99814135a3fe/pnas.2004183117fig05.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ecff/7414185/57beca1ca37a/pnas.2004183117fig06.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
The fast and the furious: Rapid long-range signaling in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8133610/,"Plants possess a systemic signaling system whereby local stimuli can lead to rapid, plant-wide responses. In addition to the redistribution of chemical messengers that range from RNAs and peptides to hormones and metabolites, a communication system acting through the transmission of electrical, Ca2+, reactive oxygen species and potentially even hydraulic signals has also been discovered. This latter system can propagate signals across many cells each second and researchers are now beginning to uncover the molecular machineries behind this rapid communications network. Thus, elements such as the reactive oxygen species producing NAPDH oxidases and ion channels of the two pore channel, glutamate receptor-like and cyclic nucleotide gated families are all required for the rapid propagation of these signals. Upon arrival at their distant targets, these changes trigger responses ranging from the production of hormones, to changes in the levels of primary metabolites and shifts in patterns of gene expression. These systemic responses occur within seconds to minutes of perception of the initial, local signal, allowing for the rapid deployment of plant-wide responses. For example, an insect starting to chew on just a single leaf triggers preemptive antiherbivore defenses throughout the plant well before it has a chance to move on to the next leaf on its menu.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plntphys.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2735/8133610/2f1a2842f013/kiaa098f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2735/8133610/c68651ff1899/kiaa098f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2735/8133610/7e215cc96834/kiaa098f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2735/8133610/15255f544214/kiaa098ilf1.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Rad-Bio-App: A discovery environment for biologists to explore spaceflight-related radiation exposures,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8113475/,"In addition to microgravity, spaceflight simultaneously exposes biology to a suite of other stimuli. For example, in space, organisms experience ionizing radiation environments that significantly differ in both quality and quantity from those normally experienced on Earth. However, data on radiation exposure during space missions is often complex to access and to understand, limiting progress towards defining how radiation affects organisms against the unique background of spaceflight. To help address this challenge, we have developed the Rad-Bio-App. This web-accessible database imports radiation metadata from experiments archived in NASA’s GeneLab data repository, and then allows the user to explore these experiments both in the context of their radiation exposure and through their other metadata and results. Rad-Bio-App provides an easy-to-use, graphically-driven environment to enable both radiation biologists and non-specialist researchers to visualize, and understand the impact of ionizing radiation on various biological systems in the context of spaceflight.

The vacuolar H+/Ca transporter CAX1 participates in submergence and anoxia stress responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9706465/,"A plant’s oxygen supply can vary from normal (normoxia) to total depletion (anoxia). Tolerance to anoxia is relevant to wetland species, rice ( Oryza sativa ) cultivation, and submergence tolerance of crops. Decoding and transmitting calcium (Ca) signals may be an important component to anoxia tolerance; however, the contribution of intracellular Ca transporters to this process is poorly understood. Four functional ca tion/proton e x changers (CAX1–4) in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) help regulate Ca homeostasis around the vacuole. Our results demonstrate that cax1 mutants are more tolerant to both anoxic conditions and submergence. Using phenotypic measurements, RNA-sequencing, and proteomic approaches, we identified cax1 -mediated anoxia changes that phenocopy changes present in anoxia-tolerant crops: altered metabolic processes, diminished reactive oxygen species production post anoxia, and altered hormone signaling. Comparing wild-type and cax1 expressing genetically encoded Ca indicators demonstrated altered cytosolic Ca signals in cax1 during reoxygenation. Anoxia-induced Ca signals around the plant vacuole are involved in the control of numerous signaling events related to adaptation to low oxygen stress. This work suggests that cax1 anoxia response pathway could be engineered to circumvent the adverse effects of flooding that impair production agriculture.

Meta-analysis of the space flight and microgravity response of the Arabidopsis plant transcriptome,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10027818/,"Spaceflight presents a multifaceted environment for plants, combining the effects on growth of many stressors and factors including altered gravity, the influence of experiment hardware, and increased radiation exposure. To help understand the plant response to this complex suite of factors this study compared transcriptomic analysis of 15 Arabidopsis thaliana spaceflight experiments deposited in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s GeneLab data repository. These data were reanalyzed for genes showing significant differential expression in spaceflight versus ground controls using a single common computational pipeline for either the microarray or the RNA-seq datasets. Such a standardized approach to analysis should greatly increase the robustness of comparisons made between datasets. This analysis was coupled with extensive cross-referencing to a curated matrix of metadata associated with these experiments. Our study reveals that factors such as analysis type (i.e., microarray versus RNA-seq) or environmental and hardware conditions have important confounding effects on comparisons seeking to define plant reactions to spaceflight. The metadata matrix allows selection of studies with high similarity scores, i.e., that share multiple elements of experimental design, such as plant age or flight hardware. Comparisons between these studies then helps reduce the complexity in drawing conclusions arising from comparisons made between experiments with very different designs.

"Low-dose, ionizing radiation and age-related changes in skeletal microarchitecture",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3337602/,"Osteoporosis can profoundly affect the aged as a consequence of progressive bone loss; high-dose ionizing radiation can cause similar changes, although less is known about lower doses (≤100 cGy). We hypothesized that exposure to relatively low doses of gamma radiation accelerates structural changes characteristic of skeletal aging. Mice (C57BL/6J-10 wk old, male) were irradiated (total body; 0-sham, 1, 10 or 100 cGy 137 Cs) and tissues harvested on the day of irradiation, 1 or 4 months later. Microcomputed tomography was used to quantify microarchitecture of high turnover, cancellous bone. Irradiation at 100 cGy caused transient microarchitectural changes over one month that were only evident at longer times in controls (4 months). Ex vivo bone cell differentiation from the marrow was unaffected by gamma radiation. In conclusion, acute ionizing gamma irradiation at 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy) exacerbated microarchitectural changes normally found during progressive, postpubertal aging prior to the onset of age-related osteoporosis.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-jar.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ffa4/3337602/575cf6ca13ed/JAR2012-481983.001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ffa4/3337602/32eb9259aa59/JAR2012-481983.002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ffa4/3337602/19705db25a5b/JAR2012-481983.003.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Ionizing Radiation Stimulates Expression of Pro-Osteoclastogenic Genes in Marrow and Skeletal Tissue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4490751/,"Exposure to ionizing radiation can cause rapid mineral loss and increase bone-resorbing osteoclasts within metabolically active, cancellous bone tissue leading to structural deficits. To better understand mechanisms involved in rapid, radiation-induced bone loss, we determined the influence of total body irradiation on expression of select cytokines known both to stimulate osteoclastogenesis and contribute to inflammatory bone disease. Adult (16 week), male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to either 2 Gy gamma rays ( 137 Cs, 0.8 Gy/min) or heavy ions ( 56 Fe, 600MeV, 0.50–1.1 Gy/min); this dose corresponds to either a single fraction of radiotherapy (typical total dose is ≥10 Gy) or accumulates over long-duration interplanetary missions. Serum, marrow, and mineralized tissue were harvested 4 h—7 days later. Gamma irradiation caused a prompt (2.6-fold within 4 h) and persistent (peaking at 4.1-fold within 1 day) rise in the expression of the obligate osteoclastogenic cytokine, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand ( Rankl ), within marrow cells over controls. Similarly, Rankl expression peaked in marrow cells within 3 days of iron exposure (9.2-fold). Changes in Rankl expression induced by gamma irradiation preceded and overlapped with a rise in expression of other pro-osteoclastic cytokines in marrow (eg, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 increased by 11.9-fold, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased by 1.7-fold over controls). The ratio, Rankl/Opg , in marrow increased by 1.8-fold, a net pro-resorption balance. In the marrow, expression of the antioxidant transcription factor, Nfe2l2 , strongly correlated with expression levels of Nfatc1 , Csf1 , Tnf , and Rankl . Radiation exposure increased a serum marker of bone resorption (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) and led to cancellous bone loss (16% decrement after 1 week). We conclude that total body irradiation (gamma or heavy-ion) caused temporal elevations in the concentrations of specific genes expressed within marrow and mineralized tissue related to bone resorption, including select cytokines that lead to osteoclastogenesis and elevated resorption; this is likely to account for rapid and progressive deterioration of cancellous microarchitecture following exposure to ionizing radiation.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-jir.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c63d/4490751/306ffeddc33a/fig-1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c63d/4490751/733051a98601/fig-2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c63d/4490751/8f20b55f4e4c/fig-3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c63d/4490751/ffedad744c64/fig-4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c63d/4490751/76b073f875cd/fig-5.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

Redox Signaling and Its Impact on Skeletal and Vascular Responses to Spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666834/,"Spaceflight entails exposure to numerous environmental challenges with the potential to contribute to both musculoskeletal and vascular dysfunction. The purpose of this review is to describe current understanding of microgravity and radiation impacts on the mammalian skeleton and associated vasculature at the level of the whole organism. Recent experiments from spaceflight and ground-based models have provided fresh insights into how these environmental stresses influence mechanisms that are related to redox signaling, oxidative stress, and tissue dysfunction. Emerging mechanistic knowledge on cellular defenses to radiation and other environmental stressors, including microgravity, are useful for both screening and developing interventions against spaceflight-induced deficits in bone and vascular function.

Influence of social isolation during prolonged simulated weightlessness by hindlimb unloading,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6753329/,"The hindlimb unloading (HU) model has been used extensively to simulate the cephalad fluid shift and musculoskeletal disuse observed in spaceflight with its application expanding to study immune, cardiovascular and central nervous system responses, among others. Most HU studies are performed with singly housed animals, although social isolation also can substantially impact behavior and physiology, and therefore may confound HU experimental results. Other HU variants that allow for paired housing have been developed although no systematic assessment has been made to understand the effects of social isolation on HU outcomes. Hence, we aimed to determine the contribution of social isolation to tissue responses to HU. To accomplish this, we developed a refinement to the traditional NASA Ames single housing HU system to accommodate social housing in pairs, retaining desirable features of the original design. We conducted a 30-day HU experiment with adult, female mice that were either singly or socially housed. HU animals in both single and social housing displayed expected musculoskeletal deficits versus housing matched, normally loaded (NL) controls. However, select immune and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses were differentially impacted by the HU social environment relative to matched NL controls. HU led to a reduction in % CD4 + T cells in singly housed, but not in socially housed mice. Unexpectedly, HU increased adrenal gland mass in socially housed but not singly housed mice, while social isolation increased adrenal gland mass in NL controls. HU also led to elevated plasma corticosterone levels at day 30 in both singly and socially housed mice. Thus, musculoskeletal responses to simulated weightlessness are similar regardless of social environment with a few differences in adrenal and immune responses. Our findings show that combined stressors can mask, not only exacerbate, select responses to HU. These findings further expand the utility of the HU model for studying possible combined effects of spaceflight stressors.

Validation of a new Rodent experimental System to investigate consequences of Long Duration Space Habitation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7012842/,"Animal models are useful for exploring the health consequences of prolonged spaceflight. Capabilities were developed to perform experiments in low earth orbit with on-board sample recovery, thereby avoiding complications caused by return to Earth. For NASA’s Rodent Research-1 mission, female mice (ten 32 wk C57BL/6NTac; ten 16 wk C57BL/6J) were launched on an unmanned vehicle, then resided on the International Space Station for 21/22d or 37d in microgravity. Mice were euthanized on-orbit, livers and spleens dissected, and remaining tissues frozen in situ for later analyses. Mice appeared healthy by daily video health checks and body, adrenal, and spleen weights of 37d-flight (FLT) mice did not differ from ground controls housed in flight hardware (GC), while thymus weights were 35% greater in FLT than GC. Mice exposed to 37d of spaceflight displayed elevated liver mass (33%) and select enzyme activities compared to GC, whereas 21/22d-FLT mice did not. FLT mice appeared more physically active than respective GC while soleus muscle showed expected atrophy. RNA and enzyme activity levels in tissues recovered on-orbit were of acceptable quality. Thus, this system establishes a new capability for conducting long-duration experiments in space, enables sample recovery on-orbit, and avoids triggering standard indices of chronic stress.

Skeletal tissue regulation by catalase over-expression in mitochondria,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4405755/,"The mechanisms triggering disuse muscle atrophy remain of debate. It is becoming evident that mitochondrial dysfunction may regulate pathways controlling muscle mass. We have recently shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a major role in disuse atrophy of soleus, a slow, oxidative muscle. Here we tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading-induced atrophy could be due to mitochondrial dysfunction in fast muscles too, notwithstanding their much lower mitochondrial content. Gastrocnemius displayed atrophy following both 3 and 7 days of unloading. SOD1 and catalase up-regulation, no H 2 O 2 accumulation and no increase of protein carbonylation suggest the antioxidant defence system efficiently reacted to redox imbalance in the early phases of disuse. A defective mitochondrial fusion (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1 down-regulation) occurred together with an impairment of OXPHOS capacity. Furthermore, at 3 days of unloading higher acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation was found, suggesting AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway activation. To test the role of mitochondrial alterations we used Tg-mice overexpressing PGC-1α because of the known effect of PGC-1α on stimulation of Mfn2 expression. PGC-α overexpression was sufficient to prevent (i) the decrease of pro-fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1), (ii) activation of the AMPK pathway, (iii) the inducible expression of MuRF1 and atrogin1 and of authopagic factors, and (iv) any muscle mass loss in response to disuse. As the effects of increased PGC-1α activity were sustained throughout disuse, compounds inducing PGC-1α expression could be useful to treat and prevent muscle atrophy also in fast muscles.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-jphysiol.gif"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/40d0/4405755/f0d45cf309af/tjp0593-1981-f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/40d0/4405755/c6d7a86040d8/tjp0593-1981-f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/40d0/4405755/158923534995/tjp0593-1981-f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/40d0/4405755/4254a6118683/tjp0593-1981-f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/40d0/4405755/14b2ad3d5158/tjp0593-1981-f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/40d0/4405755/c1bff22877b6/tjp0593-1981-f6.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/40d0/4405755/5a2e657df55d/tjp0593-1981-f7.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/40d0/4405755/23be49ffe460/tjp0593-1981-f8.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/40d0/4405755/d1daf685fd2f/tjp0593-1981-f9.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Overexpression of catalase in mitochondria mitigates changes in hippocampal cytokine expression following simulated microgravity and isolation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8260663/,"Isolation on Earth can alter physiology and signaling of organs systems, including the central nervous system. Although not in complete solitude, astronauts operate in an isolated environment during spaceflight. In this study, we determined the effects of isolation and simulated microgravity solely or combined, on the inflammatory cytokine milieu of the hippocampus. Adult female wild-type mice underwent simulated microgravity by hindlimb unloading for 30 days in single or social (paired) housing. In hippocampus, simulated microgravity and isolation each regulate a discrete repertoire of cytokines associated with inflammation. Their combined effects are not additive. A model for mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching via targeted overexpression of the human catalase gene to the mitochondria (MCAT mice), are protected from isolation- and/or simulated microgravity-induced changes in cytokine expression. These findings suggest a key role for mitochondrial ROS signaling in neuroinflammatory responses to spaceflight and prolonged bedrest, isolation, and confinement on Earth.

An extensive allelic series of Drosophila kae1 mutants reveals diverse and tissue-specific requirements for t6A biogenesis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4647464/,"N 6 -threonylcarbamoyl-adenosine (t6A) is one of the few RNA modifications that is universally present in life. This modification occurs at high frequency at position 37 of most tRNAs that decode ANN codons, and stabilizes cognate anticodon–codon interactions. Nearly all genetic studies of the t6A pathway have focused on single-celled organisms. In this study, we report the isolation of an extensive allelic series in the Drosophila ortholog of the core t6A biosynthesis factor Kae1. kae1 hemizygous larvae exhibit decreases in t6A that correlate with allele strength; however, we still detect substantial t6A-modified tRNAs even during the extended larval phase of null alleles. Nevertheless, complementation of Drosophila Kae1 and other t6A factors in corresponding yeast null mutants demonstrates that these metazoan genes execute t6A synthesis. Turning to the biological consequences of t6A loss, we characterize prominent kae1 melanotic masses and show that they are associated with lymph gland overgrowth and ectopic generation of lamellocytes. On the other hand, kae1 mutants exhibit other phenotypes that reflect insufficient tissue growth. Interestingly, whole-tissue and clonal analyses show that strongly mitotic tissues such as imaginal discs are exquisitely sensitive to loss of kae1 , whereas nonproliferating tissues are less affected. Indeed, despite overt requirements of t6A for growth of many tissues, certain strong kae1 alleles achieve and sustain enlarged body size during their extended larval phase.

A combined computational strategy of sequence and structural analysis predicts the existence of a functional eicosanoid pathway in Drosophila melanogaster.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6372189/,"This study reports on a putative eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway in Drosophila melanogaster and challenges the currently held view that mechanistic routes to synthesize eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipids do not exist in insects, since to date, putative fly homologs of most mammalian enzymes have not been identified. Here we use systematic and comprehensive bioinformatics approaches to identify most of the mammalian eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. Sensitive sequence analysis techniques identified candidate Drosophila enzymes that share low global sequence identities with their human counterparts. Twenty Drosophila candidates were selected based upon (a) sequence identity with human enzymes of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase branches, (b) similar domain architecture and structural conservation of the catalytic domain, and (c) presence of potentially equivalent functional residues. Evaluation of full-length structural models for these 20 top-scoring Drosophila candidates revealed a surprising degree of conservation in their overall folds and potential analogs for functional residues in all 20 enzymes. Although we were unable to identify any suitable candidate for lipoxygenase enzymes, we report structural homology models of three fly cyclooxygenases. Our findings predict that the D . melanogaster genome likely codes for one or more pathways for eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipid synthesis. Our study suggests that classical and/or novel eicosanoids mediators must regulate biological functions in insects–predictions that can be tested with the power of Drosophila genetics. Such experimental analysis of eicosanoid biology in a simple model organism will have high relevance to human development and health.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9bec/6372189/ad6e8246f431/pone.0211897.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9bec/6372189/780376fa69c6/pone.0211897.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9bec/6372189/05fc5a677e94/pone.0211897.g003.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Immune suppressive extracellular vesicle proteins of Leptopilina heterotoma are encoded in the wasp genome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6945029/,"Leptopilina heterotoma are obligate parasitoid wasps that develop in the body of their Drosophila hosts. During oviposition, female wasps introduce venom into the larval hosts’ body cavity. The venom contains discrete, 300 nm-wide, mixed-strategy extracellular vesicles (MSEVs), until recently referred to as virus-like particles. While the crucial immune suppressive functions of L. heterotoma MSEVs have remained undisputed, their biotic nature and origin still remain controversial. In recent proteomics analyses of L. heterotoma MSEVs, we identified 161 proteins in three classes: conserved eukaryotic proteins, infection and immunity related proteins, and proteins without clear annotation. Here we report 246 additional proteins from the L. heterotoma MSEV proteome. An enrichment analysis of the entire proteome supports vesicular nature of these structures. Sequences for more than 90% of these proteins are present in the whole-body transcriptome. Sequencing and de novo assembly of the 460 Mb-sized L. heterotoma genome revealed 90% of MSEV proteins have coding regions within the genomic scaffolds. Altogether, these results explain the stable association of MSEVs with their wasps, and like other wasp structures, their vertical inheritance. While our results do not rule out a viral origin of MSEVs, they suggest that a similar strategy for co-opting cellular machinery for immune suppression may be shared by other wasps to gain advantage over their hosts. These results are relevant to our understanding of the evolution of figitid and related wasp species.

Parasitic wasps are among the most abundant insects; they are vital to biodiversity and contribute to biological control of agricultural pests ( Narendran 2001 ; Rodriguez et al. 2013 ). A common strategy for reproductive success of parasitic wasps is suppression of immunity in their larval hosts. Parasitic wasps produce viruses or virus-like particles in tissues associated with the ovary. Wasps of the Ichneumonoidea superfamily produce symbiotic polydnaviruses (PDVs), which package circular dsDNA. PDV (Bracovirus (BV) in braconid wasps; Ichnovirus (IV) in ichneumonid wasps) genomes are integrated within the wasp genome as islands of viral genes. Upon oviposition, PDVs suppress host immunity. BVs and IVs derive from nudivirus and large DNA cytoplasmic viruses, respectively (reviewed in Strand and Burke 2015 ; Drezen et al. 2017 ; Gauthier et al. 2018 , and references therein).
Immune-suppressive virus-like particles (VLPs) ( e.g. , VcVLPs in the ichneumonid Venturia canescens and FaENVs in the braconid Fopius arisanus ) lack proviral DNA segments, but are of viral origin and transfer virulence proteins into host cells ( Pichon et al. 2015 ; Burke et al. 2018 ). Viral genes encoding VLP proteins are either dispersed in the wasp genome (as in VcVLP) or present in discrete genomic areas (as in FaENV). Thus, various independent viral endogenization events have been important for successful parasitism by these wasps ( Strand and Burke 2015 ; Gauthier et al. 2018 ).
Here, we focus on immune-suppressive particles of figitid wasps in the genus Leptopilina , that infect Drosophila spp. and are gaining importance as models for natural host-parasite interactions ( Keebaugh and Schlenke 2014 ). Leptopilina heterotoma ( Lh ), L. victoriae ( Lv ), and L. boulardi ( Lb ) produce VLPs in their venom glands. The VLPs of Leptopilina spp. and their proteins have been linked to parasite success ( Rizki et al. 1990 ; Dupas et al. 1996 ; Morales et al. 2005 ; Labrosse et al. 2005 ; Chiu et al. 2006 ; Heavner et al. 2014 ). Evidence for DNA in Leptopilina VLPs is lacking, and because of the absence of a published wasp genome, the chromosomal vs. extrachromosomal location of MSEV protein genes is not known. Our goals here are (a) to describe additional proteins in the MSEV proteome and examine their relationship with PDV and other viral proteins, and (b) determine whether MSEV genes are encoded in the wasp genome.
We recently described 161 proteins in the VLPs from two Lh strains in three classes: conserved eukaryotic with cellular function (Class 1), infection- and immunity-related (Class 2), and unannotated (novel) without similarity to known proteins (Class 3) ( Heavner et al. 2017 ). Class 1 proteins include several vesicular transport and endomembrane system proteins. Class 2 proteins include predicted modulators of immune response, e.g. , metalloendopeptidases, RhoGAPs, a knottin-like protein, and a new family of prokaryotic-like GTPases whose genes lack introns. A striking example of Class 3 proteins is p40, with three-dimensional structural similarity to Type 3 secretion system (T3SS) needle-tip proteins, IpaD/SipD/BipD from Gram-negative bacteria, Salmonella , Shigella and Burkholderia . Earlier results have indicated that the p40 gene (unlike the GTPase genes) is expected to have introns. These results suggested that Lh VLPs have novel properties with elements of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic secretion systems and possess a functionally diverse array of immune-suppressive proteins. We therefore renamed VLPs as Mixed Strategy Extracellular Vesicles (MSEVs). Their variable morphologies distinguish them from ordered PDV morphologies. Additionally, genes encoding abundant MSEV proteins p40 and GTPase are present even in antibiotic-treated wasps. These results favored a non-microbial nature for MSEVs ( Heavner et al. 2017 ).
Here, we present an analysis of an additional 246 proteins from the Lh 14 MSEV proteome to obtain a more comprehensive description. A combined analysis of these and previous results reinforce the idea that the MSEV proteome is enriched in exosomal proteins and that Class 3 proteins are not shared with either Lb or an unrelated Ganaspis spp. Whole-body transcriptome of adult Lh wasps validated the expression of the MSEV genes. De novo genomic assembly and analyses revealed 90% of conserved Insecta Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCOs), as well as a majority (375/407; ∼90%) of the MSEV proteins are encoded in the wasp genome. While we cannot rule out a viral origin of MSEVs, in aggregate, our results provide a clearer understanding of the current nature of these complex structures and strengthen the idea that specialized extracellular vesicles transfer wasp virulence factors and other parasite proteins into Drosophila host cells.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-gthree.gif"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2703/6945029/c1e90eb19f0c/1f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2703/6945029/cc7fb5466bc9/1f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2703/6945029/5750f1a977a6/1f3.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Spaceflight and simulated microgravity conditions increase virulence of Serratia marcescens in the Drosophila melanogaster infection model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7000411/,"While it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex environment. Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll , suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized.

A parasitoid wasp of Drosophila employs preemptive and reactive strategies to deplete its host's blood cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8191917/,"The wasps Leptopilina heterotoma parasitize and ingest their Drosophila hosts. They produce extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the venom that are packed with proteins, some of which perform immune suppressive functions. EV interactions with blood cells of host larvae are linked to hematopoietic depletion, immune suppression, and parasite success. But how EVs disperse within the host, enter and kill hematopoietic cells is not well understood. Using an antibody marker for L . heterotoma EVs, we show that these parasite-derived structures are readily distributed within the hosts’ hemolymphatic system. EVs converge around the tightly clustered cells of the posterior signaling center (PSC) of the larval lymph gland, a small hematopoietic organ in Drosophila . The PSC serves as a source of developmental signals in naïve animals. In wasp-infected animals, the PSC directs the differentiation of lymph gland progenitors into lamellocytes. These lamellocytes are needed to encapsulate the wasp egg and block parasite development. We found that L . heterotoma infection disassembles the PSC and PSC cells disperse into the disintegrating lymph gland lobes. Genetically manipulated PSC-less lymph glands remain non-responsive and largely intact in the face of L . heterotoma infection. We also show that the larval lymph gland progenitors use the endocytic machinery to internalize EVs. Once inside, L . heterotoma EVs damage the Rab7- and LAMP-positive late endocytic and phagolysosomal compartments. Rab5 maintains hematopoietic and immune quiescence as Rab5 knockdown results in hematopoietic over-proliferation and ectopic lamellocyte differentiation. Thus, both aspects of anti-parasite immunity, i.e., (a) phagocytosis of the wasp’s immune-suppressive EVs, and (b) progenitor differentiation for wasp egg encapsulation reside in the lymph gland. These results help explain why the lymph gland is specifically and precisely targeted for destruction. The parasite’s simultaneous and multipronged approach to block cellular immunity not only eliminates blood cells, but also tactically blocks the genetic programming needed for supplementary hematopoietic differentiation necessary for host success. In addition to its known functions in hematopoiesis, our results highlight a previously unrecognized phagocytic role of the lymph gland in cellular immunity. EV-mediated virulence strategies described for L . heterotoma are likely to be shared by other parasitoid wasps; their understanding can improve the design and development of novel therapeutics and biopesticides as well as help protect biodiversity.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plospath.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7c3e/8191917/786e3d990822/ppat.1009615.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7c3e/8191917/4473a78805e1/ppat.1009615.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7c3e/8191917/b325debea47a/ppat.1009615.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7c3e/8191917/ecfbb64a3f4c/ppat.1009615.g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7c3e/8191917/3d58fdf586a5/ppat.1009615.g005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7c3e/8191917/ed0e865bf7e5/ppat.1009615.g006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7c3e/8191917/c914d893dd8c/ppat.1009615.g007.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
In Silico Analysis of a Drosophila Parasitoid Venom Peptide Reveals Prevalence of the Cation‚ÄìPolar‚ÄìCation Clip Motif in Knottin Proteins,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9865768/,"As generalist parasitoid wasps, Leptopilina heterotoma are highly successful on many species of fruit flies of the genus Drosophila . The parasitoids produce specialized multi-strategy extracellular vesicle (EV)-like structures in their venom. Proteomic analysis identified several immunity-associated proteins, including the knottin peptide, LhKNOT, containing the structurally conserved inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) fold, which is present in proteins from diverse taxa. Our structural and docking analysis of LhKNOT’s 36-residue core knottin fold revealed that in addition to the knottin motif itself, it also possesses a Cation–Polar–Cation (CPC) clip. The CPC clip motif is thought to facilitate antimicrobial activity in heparin-binding proteins. Surprisingly, a majority of ICKs tested also possess the CPC clip motif, including 75 bona fide plant and arthropod knottin proteins that share high sequence and/or structural similarity with LhKNOT. Like LhKNOT and these other 75 knottin proteins, even the Drosophila Drosomycin antifungal peptide, a canonical target gene of the fly’s Toll-NF-kappa B immune pathway, contains this CPC clip motif. Together, our results suggest a possible defensive function for the parasitoid LhKNOT. The prevalence of the CPC clip motif, intrinsic to the cysteine knot within the knottin proteins examined here, suggests that the resultant 3D topology is important for their biochemical functions. The CPC clip is likely a highly conserved structural motif found in many diverse proteins with reported heparin binding capacity, including amyloid proteins. Knottins are targets for therapeutic drug development, and insights into their structure–function relationships will advance novel drug design.

Simultaneous exposure of cultured human lymphoblastic cells to simulated microgravity and radiation increases chromosome aberrations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7555395/,"During space travel, humans are continuously exposed to two major environmental stresses, microgravity (μ G ) and space radiation. One of the fundamental questions is whether the two stressors are interactive. For over half a century, many studies were carried out in space, as well as using devices that simulated μ G on the ground to investigate gravity effects on cells and organisms, and we have gained insights into how living organisms respond to μ G . However, our knowledge on how to assess and manage human health risks in long-term mission to the Moon or Mars is drastically limited. For example, little information is available on how cells respond to simultaneous exposure to space radiation and μ G . In this study, we analyzed the frequencies of chromosome aberrations (CA) in cultured human lymphoblastic TK6 cells exposed to X-ray or carbon ion under the simulated μ G conditions. A higher frequency of both simple and complex types of CA were observed in cells exposed to radiation and μ G simultaneously compared to CA frequency in cells exposed to radiation only. Our study shows that the dose response data on space radiation obtained at the 1 G condition could lead to the underestimation of astronauts’ potential risk for health deterioration, including cancer. This study also emphasizes the importance of obtaining data on the molecular and cellular responses to irradiation under μ G conditions.

Genes required for survival in microgravity revealed by genome-wide yeast deletion collections cultured during spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4309212/,"Spaceflight is a unique environment with profound effects on biological systems including tissue redistribution and musculoskeletal stresses. However, the more subtle biological effects of spaceflight on cells and organisms are difficult to measure in a systematic, unbiased manner. Here we test the utility of the molecularly barcoded yeast deletion collection to provide a quantitative assessment of the effects of microgravity on a model organism. We developed robust hardware to screen, in parallel, the complete collection of ~4800 homozygous and ~5900 heterozygous (including ~1100 single-copy deletions of essential genes) yeast deletion strains, each carrying unique DNA that acts as strain identifiers. We compared strain fitness for the homozygous and heterozygous yeast deletion collections grown in spaceflight and ground, as well as plus and minus hyperosmolar sodium chloride, providing a second additive stressor. The genome-wide sensitivity profiles obtained from these treatments were then queried for their similarity to a compendium of drugs whose effects on the yeast collection have been previously reported. We found that the effects of spaceflight have high concordance with the effects of DNA-damaging agents and changes in redox state, suggesting mechanisms by which spaceflight may negatively affect cell fitness.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-bmri.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/23ef/4309212/ff6207ead6fb/BMRI2015-976458.001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/23ef/4309212/a5bb1ef5f042/BMRI2015-976458.002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/23ef/4309212/a7539e3999f9/BMRI2015-976458.003.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Physical Forces Modulate Oxidative Status and Stress Defense Meditated Metabolic Adaptation of Yeast Colonies: Spaceflight and Microgravity Simulations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6560652/,"Baker’s yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) has broad genetic homology to human cells. Although typically grown as 1-2mm diameter colonies under certain conditions yeast can form very large (10 + mm in diameter) or ‘giant’ colonies on agar. Giant yeast colonies have been used to study diverse biomedical processes such as cell survival, aging, and the response to cancer pharmacogenomics. Such colonies evolve dynamically into complex stratified structures that respond differentially to environmental cues. Ammonia production, gravity driven ammonia convection, and shear defense responses are key differentiation signals for cell death and reactive oxygen system pathways in these colonies. The response to these signals can be modulated by experimental interventions such as agar composition, gene deletion and application of pharmaceuticals. In this study we used physical factors including colony rotation and microgravity to modify ammonia convection and shear stress as environmental cues and observed differences in the responses of both ammonia dependent and stress response dependent pathways We found that the effects of random positioning are distinct from rotation. Furthermore, both true and simulated microgravity exacerbated both cellular redox responses and apoptosis. These changes were largely shear-response dependent but each model had a unique response signature as measured by shear stress genes and the promoter set which regulates them These physical techniques permitted a graded manipulation of both convection and ammonia signaling and are primed to substantially contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation.

Effects of space flight on mouse liver versus kidney: Gene pathway analyses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6321533/,"Understanding genome wide, tissue-specific, and spaceflight-induced changes in gene expression is critical to develop effective countermeasures. Transcriptome analysis has been performed on diverse tissues harvested from animals flown in space, but not the kidney. We determined the genome wide gene expression using a gene array analysis of kidney and liver tissue from mice flown in space for 12 days versus ground based control animals. By comparing the transcriptome of liver and kidney from animals flown in space versus ground control animals, we tested a unique hypothesis: Are there common gene expression pathways activated in multiple tissue types in response to spaceflight stimuli? Although there were tissue-specific changes, both liver and kidney overexpressed genes in the same four areas: (a) cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogen/organonitrogen compounds; (b) apoptosis and cell death; (c) fat cell differentiation and (d) negative regulation of protein kinase.

Endocrine Effects of Space Flight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11833055/,"A study was conducted to evaluate the three-dimensional clinostat simulated microgravity effect on mouse models, focusing on the central nervous system. Eighteen mice were divided into three groups: control, survival box, and clinostat + survival box. Behavioral tests, femur micro-CT, brain transcriptomics, serum metabolomics, and fecal microbiomics were performed. Results showed decreased activity, altered gait, enhanced fear memory, bone loss, immune/endocrine changes in brain transcriptome, and altered metabolic pathways in serum and gut microbiota in clinostat-treated mice. The model closely mimics spaceflight-induced transcriptome changes, suggesting its value in studying microgravity-related neurological alterations and highlighting the need for attention to emotional changes in space.

Role of shear stress on renal proximal tubular cells for nephrotoxicity assays,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9146534/,"Increased viscosity of concentrated contrast media (CM) in the renal tubules can perturb renal hemodynamics and have a detrimental effect on tubular epithelial cells. However, the effects of viscosity on contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) remain poorly understood. Conventional in vitro culture studies do not reflect the rheological properties of CM. Therefore, we investigated the effects of CM viscosity on renal tubules using a kidney-on-a-chip and two different types of CM. Renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) were cultured in a three-dimensional microfluidic culture platform under bidirectional fluid shear stress. We treated the RPTEC with two types of CM: low- (LOCM, iopromide) and iso-osmolar contrast media (IOCM, iodixanol). Renal tubular cell injury induced by LOCM and IOCM was examined under different iodine concentrations (50–250 mgI/mL) and shear-stress conditions. LOCM showed a significant dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, which was significantly higher than that of IOCM under static and low-to-moderate shear stress conditions. However, high shear-stress resulted in reduced cell viability in IOCM; no difference between IOCM and LOCM was found under high shear-stress conditions. The cytotoxic effects were pronounced at a mean shear stress of 1 dyn/cm 2 or higher. The high viscosity of IOCM slowed the fluid flow rate and augmented fluid shear-stress. We suggest an alternative in vitro model of CIN using the three-dimensional kidney-on-a-chip. Our results indicate a vital role of viscosity-induced nephrotoxicity under high shear-stress conditions, contrary to the findings of conventional in vitro studies.

Fifteen days of microgravity causes growth in calvaria of mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4110898/,"Bone remodeling may occur in spaceflight as a response to skeletal unloading and head-ward fluid shifts. While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and density in legs of animals exposed to microgravity, increased blood and interstitial fluid flows accompanying microgravity-induced fluid redistribution may elicit an opposite effect in the head. Seven C57BL/6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight littermates served as ground controls. Upon mission completion, all 15 mice calvariae were imaged on a micro-computed tomography scanner. A standardized rectangular volume was placed on the parietal bones of each calvaria for analyses, and three parameters were determined to measure increased parietal bone volume: bone volume (BV), cross-sectional thickness (CsTh), and tissue mineral density (TMD). Microgravity exposure caused a statistically significant increase in BV of the space flight (SF) group compared to the ground control (GC) group – the mean ± SD for SF group was 10.48 ± 0.47 %, compared to 9.64 ± 0.79 % for GC group (p<0.05). CsTh demonstrated a trend of increase from 0.099 ±0.006 mm in the GC group to 0.104 ±0.005 mm in the SF group (p=0.12). TMD was similar between the two groups with 0.878 ±0.029 g/cc for GC and 0.893 ± 0.028 g/cc for SF (p=0.31). Our results indicate that microgravity causes adaptive changes in calvarial bones that do not normally bear weight. These findings suggest that fluid shifts alone accompanying microgravity may initiate bone remodeling independent of skeletal loading by tissue.

While bending motions are main contributors to herniation, the effects of microgravity on the bending properties of spinal discs are unknown. Consequently, the goal of this study was to quantify the bending properties of tail discs from mice with or without microgravity exposure. Caudal motion segments from six mice returned from a 30-day Bion M1 mission and eight vivarium controls were loaded to failure in four-point bending. After testing, specimens were processed using histology to determine the location of failure, and adjacent motion segments were scanned with micro-computed tomography (μCT) to quantify bone properties. We observed that spaceflight significantly shortened the nonlinear toe region of the force-displacement curve by 32% and reduced the bending strength by 17%. Flight mouse spinal segments tended to fail within the growth plate and epiphyseal bone, while controls tended to fail at the disc-vertebra junction. Spaceflight significantly reduced vertebral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness, which may explain the tendency of flight specimens to fail within the epiphyseal bone. Together, these results indicate that vertebral bone loss during spaceflight may degrade spine bending properties and contribute to increased disc herniation risk in astronauts.

Microgravity exposure during spaceflight negatively impacts the human spine and increases the risk for low back pain and injury. Astronauts experience a 4.3-fold increase in intervertebral disc herniation rate following spaceflight 1 ( Figs. 1 and 2 ). Herniation occurs when the annulus fibrosus or cartilage endplate junction is damaged and nucleus pulposus material extrudes through the damaged region. The extruded nucleus material can press on spinal nerves, causing severe pain and often requiring surgery. Disc herniation can be mechanically induced via a combination of hyper-flexion plus compression, 2 , 3 making herniation likely during heavy lifting events in a flexed posture.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-nihpa.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/144a/5477841/bd17587c234f/nihms868218f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/144a/5477841/d8d303006220/nihms868218f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/144a/5477841/ad3586fd4f49/nihms868218f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/144a/5477841/ec85775b8dc4/nihms868218f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/144a/5477841/399b63a071a2/nihms868218f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/144a/5477841/135d1ab18f05/nihms868218f6.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/144a/5477841/ff2acde3940f/nihms868218f7.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/144a/5477841/8c0472e28fdc/nihms868218f8.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/144a/5477841/12201decbe56/nihms868218f9.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/144a/5477841/d87d56a8de5c/nihms868218f10.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/144a/5477841/75c64039889d/nihms868218f11.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Spaceflight-associated vascular remodeling and gene expression in mouse calvaria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9139491/,"Astronauts suffer from a loss of bone mass at a rate of 1.5% per month from lower regions of the body during the course of long-duration (>30 days) spaceflight, a phenomenon that poses important risks for returning crew. Conversely, a gain in bone mass may occur in non-load bearing regions of the body as related to microgravity-induced cephalad fluid shift. Representing non-load bearing regions with mouse calvaria and leveraging the STS-131 (15-day) and BION-M1 (30-day) flights, we examined spatial and temporal calvarial vascular remodeling and gene expression related to microgravity exposure compared between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) cohorts. We examined parasagittal capillary numbers and structures in calvaria from 16 to 23 week-old C57BL/6 female mice (GC, n = 4; SF, n = 5) from STS-131 and 19–20 week-old C57BL/6 male mice (GC, n = 6; SF, n = 6) from BION-M1 using a robust isolectin-IB4 vessel marker. We found that the vessel diameter reduces significantly in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceflight relative to control. Capillarization increases by 30% (SF vs. GC, p = 0.054) in SF mice compared to GC mice. The vessel numbers and diameter remain unchanged in BION-M1 mice calvarial section. We next analyzed the parietal pro-angiogenic ( VEGFA ) and pro-osteogenic gene ( BMP-2, DMP1, RUNX2 and OCN ) expression in BION-M1 mice using quantitative RT-PCR. VEGFA gene expression increased 15-fold while BMP-2 gene expression increased 11-fold in flight mice compared to GC. The linkage between vascular morphology and gene expression in the SF conditions suggests that angiogenesis may be important in the regulation of pathological bone growth in non-weight bearing regions of the body. Short-duration microgravity-mediated bone restructuring has implications in planning effective countermeasures for long-duration flights and extraterrestrial human habitation.

"Exposure of Mycobacterium marinum to low-shear modeled microgravity: Effect on growth, the transcriptome and survival under stress.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515531/,"Waterborne pathogenic mycobacteria can form biofilms, and certain species can cause hard-to-treat human lung infections. Astronaut health could therefore be compromised if the spacecraft environment or water becomes contaminated with pathogenic mycobacteria. This work uses Mycobacterium marinum to determine the physiological changes in a pathogenic mycobacteria grown under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG). M. marinum were grown in high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) using a rotary cell culture system subjected to LSMMG or the control orientation (normal gravity, NG) and the cultures used to determine bacterial growth, bacterium size, transcriptome changes, and resistance to stress. Two exposure times to LSMMG and NG were examined: bacteria were grown for ~40 h (short), or 4 days followed by re-dilution and growth for ~35 h (long). M. marinum exposed to LSMMG transitioned from exponential phase earlier than the NG culture. They were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide but showed no change in resistance to gamma radiation or pH 3.5. RNA-Seq detected significantly altered transcript levels for 562 and 328 genes under LSMMG after short and long exposure times, respectively. Results suggest that LSMMG induced a reduction in translation, a downregulation of metabolism, an increase in lipid degradation, and increased chaperone and mycobactin expression. Sigma factor H ( sigH ) was the only sigma factor transcript induced by LSMMG after both short and long exposure times. In summary, transcriptome studies suggest that LSMMG may simulate a nutrient-deprived environment similar to that found within macrophage during infection. SigH is also implicated in the M. marinum LSMMG transcriptome response.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-npjmicrogr.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1e09/5515531/9cc26d6cf4b4/npjmgrav201638-f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1e09/5515531/fbfd4df6ff63/npjmgrav201638-f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1e09/5515531/63591f0ffe51/npjmgrav201638-f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1e09/5515531/355ff2e57f24/npjmgrav201638-f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1e09/5515531/e29e2991c300/npjmgrav201638-f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1e09/5515531/c3416ce7ea34/npjmgrav201638-f6.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Effects of mechanostimulation on gravitropism and signal persistence in flax roots.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3258067/,"Gravitropism describes curvature of plants in response to gravity or differential acceleration and clinorotation is commonly used to compensate unilateral effect of gravity. We report on experiments that examine the persistence of the gravity signal and separate mechanostimulation from gravistimulation. Flax roots were reoriented (placed horizontally for 5, 10 or 15 min) and clinorotated at a rate of 0.5 to 5 rpm either vertically (parallel to the gravity vector and root axis) or horizontally (perpendicular to the gravity vector and parallel to the root axis). Image sequences showed that horizontal clinorotation did not affect root growth rate (0.81 ± 0.03 mm h −1 ) but vertical clinorotation reduced root growth by about 7%. The angular velocity (speed of clinorotation) did not affect growth for either direction. However, maximal curvature for vertical clinorotation decreased with increasing rate of rotation and produced straight roots at 5 rpm. In contrast, horizontal clinorotation increased curvature with increasing angular velocity. The point of maximal curvature was used to determine the longevity (memory) of the gravity signal, which lasted about 120 min. The data indicate that mechanostimulation modifies the magnitude of the graviresponse but does not affect memory persistence.

Oxygen dependency of germinating Brassica seeds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10025027/,"The significant horticultural crop, cauliflower ( Brassica oleracea L. var . botrytis ) is vulnerable to the excessive salt concentration in the soil, which contributes to its scaled-down growth and productivity, among other indices. The current study examines the efficacy of hydropriming, halopriming, and osmopriming on the physio-biochemical attributes and tolerance to salinity (100 mM NaCl) in cauliflower under controlled conditions. The results showed that the salinity (100 mM NaCl) has significant deleterious impacts on cauliflower seed germination, seedling growth, and photosynthetic attributes, and provoked the production of reactive oxygen species. In contrast, different priming approaches proved beneficial in mitigating the negative effects of salinity and boosted the germination, vigor indices, seedling growth, and physio-biochemical attributes like photosynthetic pigments, protein, and proline content while suppressing oxidative damage and MDA content in cauliflower seedlings in treatment- and dose-dependent manner. PCA revealed 61% (PC1) and 15% (PC2) of the total variance with substantial positive relationships and high loading conditions on all germination attributes on PC1 with greater PC1 scores for PEG treatments showing the increased germination indices in PEG-treated seeds among all the priming treatments tested. All 13 distinct priming treatments tried clustered into three groups as per Ward's approach of systematic categorization, clustering the third group showing relatively poor germination performances. Most germination traits exhibited statistically significant associations at the p < 0.01 level. Overall, the results established the usefulness of the different priming approaches facilitating better germination, survival, and resistance against salinity in the cauliflower to be used further before sowing in the salt-affected agro-ecosystems.

"Desiccation mitigates heat stress in the resurrection fern, Pleopeltis polypodioides",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7733933/,"Although heat and desiccation stresses often coincide, the response to heat especially in desiccation tolerant plants is rarely studied. We subjected hydrated Pleopeltis polypodioides fronds to temperatures up to 50°C and dehydrated fronds up to 65°C for 24 h. The effect of heat stress was evaluated using morphological changes, photosystem (PS) II efficiency, and metabolic indicators. Pinnae of dried fronds exposed to more than 40°C curled tighter and became brittle compared to fronds dried at lower temperatures. Exposure to > 50°C leads to discolored fronds after rehydration. Hydrated fronds turned partially brown at > 35°C. Chlorophyll fluorescence (F t ) and quantum yield (Q y ) increased following re-hydration but the recovery process after 40°C treatment lasted longer than at lower temperatures. Similarly, hydrated fronds showed reduced Q y when exposed to > 40°C. Dried and hydrated fronds remained metabolically active up to 40°C. Hydroperoxides and lipid hydroperoxides in dried samples remained high up to 50°C, but decreased in hydrated fronds at > 40°C. Catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) oxidizing activities remained high up to 40°C in dehydrated fronds and up to 35°C in hydrated fronds. Major fatty acids detected in both dehydrated and hydrated fronds included palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids, oleic (18:1), linoleic (C18:2); and linolenic (C18:3) acids. Linolenic acid was most abundant. In dried fronds, all fatty acids decreased at > 35°C. The combined data indicate that the thermotolerance of dry fronds is about 55°C but is at least 10°C lower for hydrated fronds.

Transcription profile of auxin related genes during positively gravitropic hypocotyl curvature of Brassica rapa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9105288/,"Unlike typical negative gravitropic curvature, young hypocotyls of Brassica rapa and other dicots exhibit positive gravitropism. This positive curvature occurs at the base of the hypocotyl and is followed by the typical negative gravity-induced curvature. We investigated the role of auxin in both positive and negative hypocotyl curvature by examining the transcription of PIN1 , PIN3 , IAA5 and ARG1 in curving tissue. We compared tissue extraction of the convex and concave flank with Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE). Based on Ubiquitin1 ( UBQ1 ) as a reference gene, the log (2) fold change of all examined genes was determined. Transcription of the examined genes varied during the graviresponse suggesting that these genes affect differential elongation. The transcription of all genes was upregulated in the lower flank and downregulated in the upper flank during the initial downward curving period. After 48 h, the transcription profile reversed, suggesting that the ensuing negative gravicurvature is controlled by the same genes as the positive gravicurvature. High-spatial resolution profiling using SPGE revealed that the transcription profile of the examined genes was spatially distinct within the curving tissue. The comparison of the hypocotyl transcription profile with the root tip indicated that the tip tissue is a suitable reference for curving hypocotyls and that root and hypocotyl curvature are controlled by the same physiological processes.

High-gradient magnetic fields and starch metabolism: Results from a space experiment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9617909/,"Directing plant growth in weightlessness requires understanding the processes that establish plant orientation and how to manipulate them. Both gravi- and phototropism determine directional growth and previous experiments showed that high gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) can induce curvature in roots and shoots. Experiments with Brassica rapa verified that that gravitropism-like induction of curvature is possible in space and that the HGMF-responsive organelles are amyloplasts. We assessed the effect of space and HGMF based on 16 genes and compared their transcription with static growth and clinorotation. Amyloplasts size in root tips increased under weightlessness but decreased under clinorotation but not in response to magnetic fields. Amyloplast size changes were correlated with reduced amylase transcription in space samples and enhanced transcription after clinorotation. Mechanostimulation and weightlessness have opposite effects on the size of amyloplasts. The data show that plants perceive weightlessness, and that their metabolism adjusts to microgravity and mechanostimulation. Thus, clinorotation as surrogate for space research may lead to incorrect interpretations.

Lipid rafts and plant gravisensitivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9695138/,"The necessity to include plants as a component of a Bioregenerative Life Support System leads to investigations to optimize plant growth facilities as well as a better understanding of the plant cell membrane and its numerous activities in the signaling, transport, and sensing of gravity, drought, and other stressors. The cell membrane participates in numerous processes, including endo- and exocytosis and cell division, and is involved in the response to external stimuli. Variable but stabilized microdomains form in membranes that include specific lipids and proteins that became known as (detergent-resistant) membrane microdomains, or lipid rafts with various subclassifications. The composition, especially the sterol-dependent recruitment of specific proteins affects endo- and exo-membrane domains as well as plasmodesmata. The enhanced saturated fatty acid content in lipid rafts after clinorotation suggests increased rigidity and reduced membrane permeability as a primary response to abiotic and mechanical stress. These results can also be obtained with lipid-sensitive stains. The linkage of the CM to the cytoskeleton via rafts is part of the complex interactions between lipid microdomains, mechanosensitive ion channels, and the organization of the cytoskeleton. These intricately linked structures and functions provide multiple future research directions to elucidate the role of lipid rafts in physiological processes.

Expression and characterization of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS in Xenopus laevis oocytes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3503204/,"Like many other organisms, plants are capable of sensing and responding to mechanical stimuli such as touch, osmotic pressure, and gravity. One mechanism for the perception of force is the activation of mechanosensitive (or stretch-activated) ion channels, and a number of mechanosensitive channel activities have been described in plant membranes. Based on their homology to the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS, the 10 MscS-Like (MSL) proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana have been hypothesized to form mechanosensitive channels in plant cell and organelle membranes. However, definitive proof that MSLs form mechanosensitive channels has been lacking. Here we used single-channel patch clamp electrophysiology to show that MSL10 is capable of providing a MS channel activity when heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This channel had a conductance of ∼100 pS, consistent with the hypothesis that it underlies an activity previously observed in the plasma membrane of plant root cells. We found that MSL10 formed a channel with a moderate preference for anions, which was modulated by strongly positive and negative membrane potentials, and was reversibly inhibited by gadolinium, a known inhibitor of mechanosensitive channels. MSL10 demonstrated asymmetric activation/inactivation kinetics, with the channel closing at substantially lower tensions than channel opening. The electrophysiological characterization of MSL10 reported here provides insight into the evolution of structure and function of this important family of proteins.
The perception of mechanical stimuli like gravity, touch, or osmotic pressure is essential to normal plant growth and development and is further implicated in biotic and abiotic stress responses ( 1 ). One of the best-studied strategies for perceiving force involves membrane-embedded channels that are gated by tension, known as mechanosensitive (MS) channels ( 2 ). Numerous MS channel activities (>17 to date) have been described in the membranes of diverse tissues from a variety of plant species (summarized in ref. 3 , also refs. 4 and 5 ). Many of these observed MS channel activities differ in their conductance, ion selectivity, and/or sensitivity to the direction of activation pressure, suggesting that multiple classes of mechanosensitive channels are present in plant cells.
No mechanosensitive ion channel activity discovered in plant membranes has yet been definitively identified at the molecular level, but two families of proteins serve as strong candidates. The first is the Mid1-Complementing Activity (MCA) family, members of which are required for root response to touch in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana , induce Ca 2+ uptake in rice and Arabidopsis cells ( 6 , 7 ), and are associated with increased current in response to hypotonic stimulation of Xenopus oocytes ( 8 ). The second family of candidates for plant MS channels is the MscS-Like (MSL) family, first identified based on modest homology to the well-characterized bacterial MS channel MscS from Escherichia coli ( 3 , 9 ). MscS is a largely nonselective stretch-activated channel that is gated directly by membrane tension, generating a 1-nanoSiemen (nS) conductance (reviewed in refs. 10 and 11 ). The primary function of MscS is to provide a conduit for the release of osmolytes from the bacterium in response to extreme hypoosmotic stress ( 12 , 13 ).
There are 10 MscS homologs in Arabidopsis , three with predicted or observed localization to organellar membranes and seven with predicted or observed localization to the plasma and vacuolar membranes ( 3 , 5 , 14 ). Reverse genetic analyses have demonstrated that two plastid-localized homologs, MSL2 and MSL3, are required for the proper size, shape, division, and hypoosmotic volume control of plastids ( 14 – 16 ). In addition, two plasma membrane-localized homologs, MSL9 and MSL10, are genetically required for the predominant MS channel activity in the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis root cell protoplasts, providing support for the hypothesis that MSL proteins form MS channels ( 5 ). A MscS homolog from the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, MSC1, has MS channel activity when expressed in giant E. coli spheroplasts ( 17 ).
However, it has been proposed that the contribution of MSL9 and MSL10 to MS channel activity in root protoplasts may be indirect ( 1 ), and a more rigorous test by expression and electrophysiological characterization in a heterologous system is needed. Indeed, it seems likely that MSLs do not form MS channels, because the plasma membrane-localized MscS homologs from plants are highly divergent from MscS with respect to topology and show limited sequence similarity, even within the conserved domain ( Fig. S1 ). Some bacterial MscS homologs do not appear to provide MS channel activities, further suggesting that a subset of the family has evolved to perform diverse functions (reviewed in ref. 18 ). We were thus motivated to develop a system for the electrophysiological investigation of MSL proteins to determine whether eukaryotic plasma membrane-localized MscS homologs indeed form MS channels and, if so, to compare their electrophysiological behavior with that of other MscS homologs. Here, we describe the heterologous expression and characterization of Arabidopsis MSL10 in Xenopus laevis oocytes.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-pnas.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3cc2/3503204/ef7f577eaacf/pnas.1213931109fig01.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3cc2/3503204/d718bbb9ec9a/pnas.1213931109fig02.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3cc2/3503204/5300c4319a06/pnas.1213931109fig03.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3cc2/3503204/d7f246d2088d/pnas.1213931109fig04.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
United in Diversity: Mechanosensitive Ion Channels in Plants,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5896955/,"Somatosensory neurons mediate responses to diverse mechanical stimuli, from innocuous touch to noxious pain. While recent studies have identified distinct populations of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) that are required for mechanical pain, the molecular underpinnings of mechanonociception remain unknown. Here, we show that the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and S1P Receptor 3 (S1PR3) are critical regulators of acute mechanonociception. Genetic or pharmacological ablation of S1PR3, or blockade of S1P production, significantly impaired the behavioral response to noxious mechanical stimuli, with no effect on responses to innocuous touch or thermal stimuli. These effects are mediated by fast-conducting A mechanonociceptors, which displayed a significant decrease in mechanosensitivity in S1PR3 mutant mice. We show that S1PR3 signaling tunes mechanonociceptor excitability via modulation of KCNQ2/3 channels. Our findings define a new role for S1PR3 in regulating neuronal excitability and establish the importance of S1P/S1PR3 signaling in the setting of mechanical pain thresholds.

Expressing and Characterizing Mechanosensitive Channels in Xenopus Oocytes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4469364/,"The oocytes of the African clawed frog ( Xenopus laevis ) comprise one of the most widely used membrane protein expression systems. While frequently used for studies of transporters and ion channels, the application of this system to the study of mechanosensitive ion channels has been overlooked, perhaps due to a relative abundance of native expression systems. Recent advances, however, have illustrated the advantages of the oocyte system for studying plant and bacterial mechanosensitive channels. Here we describe in detail the methods used for heterologous expression and characterization of bacterial and plant mechanosensitive channels in Xenopus oocytes.

Plastid osmotic stress influences cell differentiation at the plant shoot apex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5047659/,"The balance between proliferation and differentiation in the plant shoot apical meristem is controlled by regulatory loops involving the phytohormone cytokinin and stem cell identity genes. Concurrently, cellular differentiation in the developing shoot is coordinated with the environmental and developmental status of plastids within those cells. Here, we employ an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant exhibiting constitutive plastid osmotic stress to investigate the molecular and genetic pathways connecting plastid osmotic stress with cell differentiation at the shoot apex. msl2 msl3 mutants exhibit dramatically enlarged and deformed plastids in the shoot apical meristem, and develop a mass of callus tissue at the shoot apex. Callus production in this mutant requires the cytokinin receptor AHK2 and is characterized by increased cytokinin levels, downregulation of cytokinin signaling inhibitors ARR7 and ARR15, and induction of the stem cell identity gene WUSCHEL . Furthermore, plastid stress-induced apical callus production requires elevated plastidic reactive oxygen species, ABA biosynthesis, the retrograde signaling protein GUN1, and ABI4. These results are consistent with a model wherein the cytokinin/WUS pathway and retrograde signaling control cell differentiation at the shoot apex.

Spaceflight-induced synaptic modifications within hair cells of the mammalian utricle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5454470/,"Exposure to the microgravity conditions of spaceflight alleviates the load normally imposed by the Earth’s gravitational field on the inner ear utricular epithelia. Previous ultrastructural investigations have shown that spaceflight induces an increase in synapse density within hair cells of the rat utricle. However, the utricle exhibits broad physiological heterogeneity across different epithelial regions, and it is unknown whether capabilities for synaptic plasticity generalize to hair cells across its topography. To achieve systematic and broader sampling of the epithelium than was previously conducted, we used immunohistochemistry and volumetric image analyses to quantify synapse distributions across representative utricular regions in specimens from mice exposed to spaceflight (a 15-day mission of the space shuttle Discovery). These measures were compared with similarly sampled Earth-bound controls. Following paraformaldehyde fixation and microdissection, immunohistochemistry was performed on intact specimens to label presynaptic ribbons (anti-CtBP2) and postsynaptic receptor complexes (anti-Shank1A). Synapses were identified as closely apposed pre- and postsynaptic puncta. Epithelia from horizontal semicircular canal cristae served as “within-specimen” controls, whereas utricles and cristae from Earth-bound cohorts served as experimental controls. We found that synapse densities decreased in the medial extrastriolae of microgravity specimens compared with experimental controls, whereas they were unchanged in the striolae and horizontal cristae from the two conditions. These data demonstrate that structural plasticity was topographically localized to the utricular region that encodes very low frequency and static changes in linear acceleration, and illuminates the remarkable capabilities of utricular hair cells for synaptic plasticity in adapting to novel gravitational environments.
NEW & NOTEWORTHY Spaceflight imposes a radically different sensory environment from that in which the inner ear utricle normally operates. We investigated synaptic modifications in utricles from mice flown aboard a space shuttle mission. Structural synaptic plasticity was detected in the medial extrastriola, a region associated with encoding static head position, as decreased synapse density. These results are remarkably congruent with a recent report of decreased utricular function in astronauts immediately after returning from the International Space Station.
sensory adaptation may be manifested as an alteration in the coding of natural stimuli subsequent to changes in the ambient sensory environment. For inner ear gravity receptors, the utricle and saccule, this environment is dominated by Earth gravity, which is constant over an organism’s lifetime, and chronic alterations in receptor loading are not known to exist. However, alterations in the gravity environment are experienced with spaceflight, and they can be implemented in the laboratory through chronic centrifugation. This raises questions concerning the capabilities of these sensory epithelia for adaptive modifications that may result from exposure to ambient gravitational field alterations, despite the absence of natural conditions in which such alterations may exist.
Previous spaceflight studies have demonstrated that hair cells of the mammalian utricle exhibit the capability for synaptic plasticity ( Ross 1993 , 1994 , 2000 ; Ross and Varelas 2005 ). In these studies, which were based on analyses of serial transmission electron micrographs, it was reported that microgravity exposures of 9–13 days resulted in synaptic ribbon density increases within utricular hair cells. The greatest changes were found in specimens harvested in-flight (i.e., avoiding the gravity transitions associated with return to Earth gravity). Although increased synapse densities were found in both type I and II hair cells in flight-harvested specimens, analyses were not conducted from multiple loci across the topography of the utricle, and therefore it is not known whether parallel changes occurred in hair cells from different utricular regions. This is particularly important in view of the heterogeneity of response characteristics reflected by afferents projecting from different utricular regions ( Goldberg et al. 1990a , 1990b ).
The significance of Ross’s findings is the demonstration that adult utricular hair cells can undergo synaptic modifications, despite the absence of any obvious conditions in which they would be naturally invoked. As noted above, it has yet to be determined whether hair cells in all regions of the utricle exhibit the capacity for synaptic plasticity. Resolution of this question will be informative of the underlying factors driving the synaptic modifications in view of the differential sensitivity to dynamic linear acceleration stimuli across the utricular topography. For example, afferents projecting from extrastriolar and striolar utricular regions exhibit heterogeneity in their dynamic response characteristics ( Eatock and Songer 2011 ), whereby the low-pass characteristics of extrastriolar afferents enable them to signal steady-state changes in head orientation relative to Earth gravity ( Fernández and Goldberg 1976a ; Goldberg et al. 1990b ). In contrast, steady-state stimuli are less effectively transmitted by striolar afferents ( Fernández and Goldberg 1976a ; Goldberg et al. 1990a , 1990b ) due to pre- and postsynaptic factors that include the expression of delayed rectifier potassium conductances in type I hair cells ( Rüsch et al. 1998 ) and low-voltage-activated potassium conductances in afferent calyces ( Lysakowski et al. 2011 ; Meredith and Rennie 2015 ). Consequently, a finding of structural plasticity confined to the extrastriola would be consistent with the preferential sensitivity to steady-state stimuli within this region and a reflection of potential afferent response modifications in the new gravitational environment. On the other hand, plasticity found in all regions of the utricle could also result from a variety of uncontrolled variables associated with the spaceflight environment that are not specifically related to gravity (e.g., radiation).
In this report, we present our findings of synapse quantification from the utricles of mice that constituted a portion of the biological payload aboard the space shuttle Discovery on STS-131, which launched on April 5, 2010, and landed on April 20, 2010. We analyzed these specimens for structural synaptic plasticity by using immunohistochemical methods to identify closely apposed immunofluorescent puncta representing presynaptic ribbons and postsynaptic receptor complexes. These specimens were compared with those harvested from control mice that were maintained in habitat modules identical to those housing animals on the shuttle middeck, and for identical periods.

Hyperoxia inhibits T cell activation in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11470607/,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe lung disease in preterm infants, the abnormal proliferate and differentiate ability of type II epithelial cells (AEC II) is the key to the pathological basis of BPD. Mechanisms regarding abnormal AEC II in BPD remain unclear. The present work investigated the role and mechanisms of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in lung disorder in BPD using public datasets, clinical samples, a hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model and AEC II-iNKT cells transwell co-culture system. Firstly, we found that the NKT cells development factor IL-15 increased over time in patients with BPD in public databases, and clinically collected peripheral blood NKT cells in patients with BPD were increased. Subsequently, the percentage of iNKT cells increased in hyperoxia group compared with normoxia group, with the highest at P7, accompanied by increased activation with abnormal lung development. The administration of anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody to inhibit iNKT cells could alleviate the abnormal lung development of hyperoxia group mice, while α-GalCer administration could aggravate lung injury in hyperoxia group mice, and adoptive transfer of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal lung development in hyperoxia group mice. In addition, to further verify the role of iNKT cells on AEC II, AEC II-iNKT cells co-culture system was established. The presence of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal expression of SP-C and T1α under hyperoxia. Meanwhile, RNA-seq analysis showed that ferroptosis-related genes were highly expressed in AEC II co-cultured with iNKT cells under hyperoxia. We further validated the effect of the presence of iNKT cells under hyperoxia environment on AEC II ferroptosis levels, suggested that iNKT cells promote AEC II ferroptosis under hyperoxia, accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1α. Our study found that the recruitment of iNKT cells in the lung may be an important cause of alveolarization disorder in BPD.

"Effects of gravitational mechanical unloading in endothelial cells: association between caveolins, inflammation and adhesion molecules",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603133/,"Mechanical forces including gravity affect endothelial cell (ECs) function, and have been implicated in vascular disease as well as physiologic changes associated with low gravity environments. The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of gravitational mechanical unloading on ECs phenotype as determined by patterns of gene expression. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells were exposed to 1-gravity environment or mechanical unloading (MU) for 24 hours, with or without periods of mechanical loading (ML). MU led to a significant decrease in gene expression of several adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the contrary, eNOS, Caveolin-1 and -2 expression were significantly increased with MU. There was a decrease in the length and width of the cells with MU. Addition of ML during the MU period was sufficient to reverse the changes triggered by MU. Our results suggest that gravitational loading could dramatically affect vascular endothelial cell function.
Alterations in endothelial function has been involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases on Earth through angiogenesis, vascular remodeling and atherosclerosis 1 , 2 , 3 . Changes in endothelial hemostasis have also been associated with post-spaceflight orthostatic intolerance 4 . Hence understanding functioning of the vascular endothelium becomes critical for different diseases pathogenesis. The healthy endothelium maintains a critical relationship with the outside environment through the blood and hemodynamic forces. This relationship is governed by a well-studied frictional force: shear stress 5 , 6 . Regulation of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) responses to shear stress involve a complex cascades of gene responses with different temporal profiles and shear stress impacts ECs morphology, function and gene expression, the latter taking place transcriptionally and/or post-trancriptionally 7 . In fact, DNA microarray analysis has demonstrated that 3% of all genes responded to shear stress 8 . If ECs express 20,000 genes, then approximately 600 would be responsive to shear stress.
The cytoskeleton is at the center of the ECs responses to shear stress. The cells respond to rapid laminar flow by becoming spindle-shaped and aligned with their long axis parallel to the direction of blood flow 9 . This is accompanied by cytoskeletal reorganization with actin filaments rearranged into bundles of stress fibers and aligned in the direction of the shear stress 10 , 11 , 12 . When flow is turbulent or stagnant, the cells become rounder in shape and do not have a uniform orientation 13 , 14 . Hence, the cytoskeleton is critical in sensing mechanical forces, with a change in their morphology leading to changes in inflammation and atherogenesis 15 , 16 .
Although shear stress has been studied extensively, mechanotransduction, that is the mechanisms by which cells convert mechanical stimulus into chemical activity are not fully understood. It is thought that “sensing” of mechanical forces and shear stress signal transduction through the cytoskeleton take place, at least partially through caveolae 17 , 18 , 19 . The caveolae are membrane microdomains measuring approximately 50–10 nm in length that are visible as flask-shaped invaginations below the surface of cells, containing many signaling molecules 20 . In response to increased flow, calcium gradients develop close to caveolae and propagate through the entire cell in the form of a calcium wave 21 . The calcium increase close to caveolae causes the caveolae to rapidly liberate the nitric oxide (NO) synthase eNOS into the cytoplasm, where it catalyzes the production of NO. Caveolins have also been reported to be involved in the early phases of atherosclerosis 22 with absence of caveolin-1 in mice characterized by impaired blood-flow-dependent vascular remodeling and vasodilator responses 23 .
In-vitro techniques used to study mechanotransduction have included fluid flow (sheer stress), four-point bending, substrate stretch, as well as gravity force, vibration, magnetic fields, atomic forces and shockwaves 24 . The effects of gravitational forces on mechanotransduction in ECs responses have been the matter of only a few investigations and remain largely unknown. It is well known that astronauts experience cardiovascular deconditioning during spaceflight manifested among others as orthostatic intolerance, and some investigators have suggested that the nitric oxide system is involved in these changes 4 . At the physiological level, we demonstrated changes in the cardiovascular system with simulated microgravity characterized by alterations in sympathetic function, the renin-angiotensin system and electrolyte excretion 25 , 26 , 27 . Overall, understanding the effects of gravitational mechanical forces is important as mechanical unloading (MU) of cells has been shown to alter cell cytoskeleton 28 , affect caveolae 29 and eNOS 30 , 31 . If shear stress can affect the cytoskeleton, cell function and expression, can gravitational mechanical forces do the same? Since caveolins are gravity-sensing elements and eNOS is tightly related to inflammation and cell-cell interaction including adhesion 32 , could microgravity have the potential to alter processes such as inflammation and cell-to-cell interaction?
In this report, we investigate the effects of gravitational MU on primary ECs. The goals are to assess whether cell morphology is involved in functions such as eNOS regulation, inflammation and adhesion.

Molecular mechanisms underlying the enhanced functions of three-dimensional hepatocyte aggregates,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4012541/,"Three-dimensional (3D) culture of hepatocytes leads to improved and prolonged synthetic and metabolic functions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. In order to investigate the role of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining hepatocyte differentiated functions ex vivo , primary mouse hepatocytes were cultured either as monolayers on tissue culture dishes (TCD) or as 3D aggregates in rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors. Global gene expression analyses revealed that genes upregulated in 3D culture were distinct from those upregulated during liver development and liver regeneration. Instead, they represented a diverse array of hepatocyte-specific functional genes with significant over-representation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α ( Hnf4a ) binding sites in their promoters. Expression of Hnf4a and many of its downstream target genes were significantly increased in RWV cultures as compared to TCD. Conversely, there was concomitant suppression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes in RWV cultures that were induced in TCDs. These findings illustrate the importance of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining fundamental molecular pathways of hepatocyte function and serve as a basis for rational design of biomaterials that aim to optimize hepatocyte functions ex vivo for biomedical applications.

Spaceflight alters expression of microRNA during T-cell activation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4653058/,"Altered immune function has been demonstrated in astronauts during spaceflights dating back to Apollo and Skylab; this could be a major barrier to long-term space exploration. We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight causes changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression. Human leukocytes were stimulated with mitogens on board the International Space Station using an onboard normal gravity control. Bioinformatics showed that miR-21 was significantly up-regulated 2-fold during early T-cell activation in normal gravity, and gene expression was suppressed under microgravity. This was confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR ( n = 4). This is the first report that spaceflight regulates miRNA expression. Global microarray analysis showed significant ( P < 0.05) suppression of 85 genes under microgravity conditions compared to normal gravity samples. EGR3 , FASLG, BTG2, SPRY2, and TAGAP are biologically confirmed targets and are co-up-regulated with miR-21. These genes share common promoter regions with pre-mir-21; as the miR-21 matures and accumulates, it most likely will inhibit translation of its target genes and limit the immune response. These data suggest that gravity regulates T-cell activation not only by transcription promotion but also by blocking translation via noncoding RNA mechanisms. Moreover, this study suggests that T-cell activation itself may induce a sequence of gene expressions that is self-limited by miR-21.—Hughes-Fulford, M., Chang, T. T., Martinez, E. M., Li, C.-F. Spaceflight alters expression of microRNA during T-cell activation.

Over 50% of the Apollo astronauts had bacterial or viral infections during flight or within 1 wk of landing ( 1 ). Apollo 7 marked humanity’s first experience with spaceflight infection when all 3 crew members contracted head colds during their mission. On Apollo 13, one astronaut contracted Pseudomonas aeruginosa and experienced intense chills and fever ( 1 ). P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that rarely causes disease unless the person is immunosuppressed. As a result, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) implemented a preflight quarantine program that subsequently reduced the number of reported infections to a single Apollo astronaut ( 1 ). To this day, the preflight quarantine program is still actively used in both the U.S. and Russian programs. Even with the precautions, astronauts working on Skylab ( 2 ), Shuttle ( 3 , 4 ), International Space Station (ISS) ( 3 ), and Soyuz ( 5 ) showed changes in immune function and depressed lymphocyte activation compared to levels before spaceflight. Experiments from Skylab and Shuttle have confirmed that T cells have a suppressed immune response ( in vivo and in vitro ) with lower T-cell proliferation/activation, lower IL-2 synthesis and severely reduced IL-2-Rα expression (RNA and protein) ( 6 – 9 ). More recently, our ISS experiments proved that microgravity of spaceflight was a major cause of decrease of T-cell activation and altered gene expression in microgravity compared to onboard normal gravity controls ( 10 ). Immunosuppression during spaceflight may increase the risk of opportunistic infections. Shuttle astronauts on short duration (11 d) spaceflights had significant increases in early viral gene transcription of the Epstein-Barr virus compared to healthy controls, while astronauts on board the ISS for long-duration spaceflight (180 d) had latent and lytic viral gene expression that resembled activation patterns observed during infectious mononucleosis ( 3 , 11 ).
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were first discovered in 1993 in Caenorhabditis elegans when miRNA lin-4 was seen to down-regulate expression of the gene lin-14; however, there were no homologs to lin-4 in other species. The later discovery of miRNAs in other species, including humans, showed that miRNAs are common in eukaryotes. Previous studies have shown that key miRNAs are up-regulated after activation of human T cells ( 12 ). Here we present our discovery of dysregulation of miRNA gene expression by gravity during early T-cell activation in spaceflight. We recently proved that the lack of immune response in microgravity occurs at the cellular level ( 10 ) and identified promoter regions, transcription factors, and signal transduction pathways regulating human T-cell gene activation under normal and altered gravity conditions ( 10 , 13 , 14 ). To our knowledge, this is the first time that miRNAs have been analyzed using an onboard normal gravity control centrifuge eliminating possible confounders such as launch effects, cosmic radiation, and vibration, leaving only gravity conditions as a variable. Our data suggest that gravity regulates T-cell gene expression by 2 separate mechanisms during immune activation. Additionally, our finding that several miR-21 targets are co-up-regulated with miR-21 during early activation suggests that miR-21 may be involved in a previously unrecognized autoregulatory loop that limits the duration of normal T-cell activation.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-fasebj.gif"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bc94/4653058/832a254c8172/fasebj277392f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bc94/4653058/7542e01c0f4d/fasebj277392f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bc94/4653058/50252e8cd1b8/fasebj277392f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bc94/4653058/a02297ef722f/fasebj277392f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bc94/4653058/e55747672282/fasebj277392f5.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Spaceflight impairs antigen-specific tolerance induction in vivo and increases inflammatory cytokines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6137544/,"The health risks of a dysregulated immune response during spaceflight are important to understand as plans emerge for humans to embark on long-term space travel to Mars. In this first-of-its-kind study, we used adoptive transfer of T-cell receptor transgenic OT-II CD4 T cells to track an in vivo antigen-specific immune response that was induced during the course of spaceflight. Experimental mice destined for spaceflight and mice that remained on the ground received transferred OT-II cells and cognate peptide stimulation with ovalbumin (OVA) 323-339 plus the inflammatory adjuvant, monophosphoryl lipid A. Control mice in both flight and ground cohorts received monophosphoryl lipid A alone without additional OVA stimulation. Numbers of OT-II cells in flight mice treated with OVA were significantly increased by 2-fold compared with ground mice treated with OVA, suggesting that tolerance induction was impaired by spaceflight. Production of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly increased in flight compared with ground mice, including a 5-fold increase in IFN-γ and a 10-fold increase in IL-17. This study is the first to show that immune tolerance may be impaired in spaceflight, leading to excessive inflammatory responses.—Chang, T. T., Spurlock, S. M, Candelario, T. L. T., Grenon, S.

Immune dysregulation in microgravity, defined as 10 − 3 to 10 − 6 of normal gravity near Earth’s surface (1 g ), is predicted to be a significant challenge to human health during long-term space travel and habitation ( 1 , 2 ). Evidence indicates that dysregulated CD4 T-cell–mediated immunity is a major mechanism of spaceflight-associated immune dysfunction. The response of T cells isolated from humans postflight to phytohemagglutinin mitogen stimulation was significantly reduced compared with preflight ( 3 ). Importantly, delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions mediated by CD4 T cells were significantly reduced in astronauts when antigenic challenge was administered during flight compared with preflight ( 4 ). Spaceflight in vitro studies showed that microgravity directly disrupted T-cell activation independently of systemic factors such as the stress response. Cultures of leukocytes isolated from human peripheral blood that were stimulated during spaceflight with the T-cell mitogen concanavalin A (ConA) demonstrated profoundly suppressed T-cell proliferation compared with ground control animals ( 5 ). T cells activated with either anti-CD3 alone or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 demonstrated significantly decreased surface expression of CD25 (high-affinity IL-2 receptor or IL-2Rα) in microgravity comparison to 1 g -centrifuge controls in flight ( 6 ). Expression of IL-2, CD25, and numerous cytokines and chemokines were significantly decreased in T cells activated with ConA in ground-based simulated microgravity compared with 1 g ( 7 – 9 ). In addition, differential expression analysis of immediate early genes revealed that Rel/NF-κB signal transduction was likely a major pathway affected by microgravity in T-cell activation compared with 1 g -centrifuge controls in flight ( 10 ). These findings indicated that spaceflight altered CD4 T-cell responses independently of the systemic stress response and that microgravity inhibited T-cell activation by mitogens at the cellular level.
What remained unknown after these studies was what would happen to humans exposed to infectious agents during long-term spaceflight, such as on a voyage to Mars, or if stationed for a prolonged period on an outpost in space. Critical to answering this question was to determine the effect of spaceflight on the response of CD4 T cells to cognate peptide–major histocompatibility complex stimulation in vivo . Although it is possible that human space travelers may encounter novel extraterrestrial microbes, a more likely scenario is that they would continue to contend with hitchhiking Earth-derived microorganisms to which there was immunologic experience and established immune memory. Earth-derived bacteria, fungi, and viruses are brought into space through normal human skin, oral, and gastrointestinal flora. Studies have shown that numerous species of common Earth bacteria and fungi could be cultured from the environment of the Mir and International Space Stations and that the degree of microbial contamination increased with time ( 11 , 12 ). In addition, latent viral infections have been shown to reactivate in astronauts during spaceflight ( 13 ). Memory CD4 T-cell responses to these bacteria, fungi, and viruses may be altered during spaceflight because normal T-cell activation is inhibited by microgravity. An easily treatable infection on Earth may have serious consequences if acquired in space because of the associated immune dysregulation.
In order to test and track a physiologic antigen-specific response in vivo during the course of spaceflight, we used the well-vetted adoptive transfer model of T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic T cells in mice ( 14 ). In our chosen experimental system, small numbers of T cells from CD45.2-expressing OT-II transgenic mice, in which almost all T cells expressed a single TCR specific to ovalbumin (OVA) peptide 323-339 ( 15 ), were transferred into congenic CD45.1 C57BL/6 mice with a normal immune repertoire. Memory CD4 T cells have been shown to rapidly generate from effector CD4 T cells after in vitro activation ( 16 , 17 ). Therefore, we first activated OT-II transgenic T cells with OVA peptide in vitro and then adoptively transferred them into recipients just before launch in order to test the development and maintenance of CD4 T-cell memory during spaceflight. Experimental mice were rechallenged in vivo during spaceflight with OVA peptide in an inflammatory adjuvant to determine the likely outcome of a memory CD4 T-cell response to infection. The OVA-specific memory CD4 T-cell response was specifically tracked using the congenic surface marker CD45.2 expressed on transferred OT-II T cells.
As a result of limitations of the spaceflight hardware and crew time availability, our experiment was designed to be self-contained and internally delivered the dose protocol during the 15 d flight mission on Space Transport System (STS)-131 without requirement of astronaut time. Antigen delivery to recipient mice during spaceflight was achieved through minipumps preloaded with treatment and surgically implanted subcutaneously into mice before flight. The minipumps delivered 2 burst-releases of antigen several days into the flight mission in order to test the immune system after mice have acclimatized to spaceflight and a few days of in vivo quiescence in the absence of antigen. OVA peptide was delivered mixed with the inflammatory adjuvant, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), in order to simulate the context of an infection in vivo . MPLA is a low-toxicity derivative of LPS, a component of the cell membranes of gram-negative bacteria. MPLA has been used successfully as an adjuvant in vaccines instead of LPS because, like LPS, it is a TLR4 agonist ( 18 ). The reduced toxicity of MPLA is related to reduced potency at producing inflammation compared with LPS. Because infectious pathogens and toxic materials like LPS were not allowed on flight missions, use of MPLA as an adjuvant was the best choice to test the CD4 T-cell memory response to infection in vivo during spaceflight.
Our experimental design examined 4 groups of mice in order to comprehensively characterize the effect of spaceflight on the antigen-specific CD4 T-cell response in vivo using the internal in situ delivery of adjuvant/antigen: ground mice stimulated with MPLA alone (ground control), ground mice stimulated with MPLA plus OVA peptide (ground OVA), flight mice stimulated with MPLA alone (flight control), and flight mice stimulated with MPLA plus OVA peptide (flight OVA). Unexpectedly, we found that our experimental protocol led to impaired tolerance induction in mice that received OVA challenge during spaceflight. Although not the original intention of the experimental design, these results allowed us to discover a unique effect of spaceflight on in vivo tolerance induction. This study is the first detailed analysis of an antigen-specific immune response upon antigenic challenge in the mouse during the course of spaceflight. The findings are an important advance in our understanding of the potential impact of spaceflight immune dysregulation on human space travelers and provide additional insight on the mechanisms of immune tolerance here on Earth.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-fasebj.gif"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c3dc/6137544/25d6a9acf3e0/fasebj275073f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c3dc/6137544/23d30b803bfe/fasebj275073f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c3dc/6137544/c0862e0cb1ad/fasebj275073f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c3dc/6137544/25f08b0f81cb/fasebj275073f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c3dc/6137544/61fc110b4f93/fasebj275073f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c3dc/6137544/7d1cafac9490/fasebj275073f6.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
"From cellular mechanotransduction to biologically inspired engineering: 2009 Pritzker Award Lecture, BMES Annual Meeting October 10, 2009.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2913424/,"This article is based on a lecture I presented as the recipient of the 2009 Pritzker Distinguished Lecturer Award at the Biomedical Engineering Society annual meeting in October 2009. Here, I review more than thirty years of research from my laboratory, beginning with studies designed to test the theory that cells use tensegrity (tensional integrity) architecture to stabilize their shape and sense mechanical signals, which I believed to be critical for control of cell function and tissue development. Although I was trained as a cell biologist, I found that the tools I had at my disposal were insufficient to experimentally test these theories, and thus I ventured into engineering to find critical solutions. This path has been extremely fruitful as it has led to confirmation of the critical role that physical forces play in developmental control, as well as how cells sense and respond to mechanical signals at the molecular level through a process known as cellular mechanotransduction. Many of the predictions of the cellular tensegrity model relating to cell mechanical behaviors have been shown to be valid, and this vision of cell structure led to discovery of the central role that transmembrane adhesion receptors, such as integrins, and the cytoskeleton play in mechanosensing and mechanochemical conversion. In addition, these fundamental studies have led to significant unexpected technology fallout, including development of micromagnetic actuators for non-invasive control of cellular signaling, microfluidic systems as therapeutic extracorporeal devices for sepsis therapy, and new DNA-based nanobiotechnology approaches that permit construction of artificial tensegrities that mimic properties of living materials for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

Crewmember microbiome may influence microbial composition of ISS habitable surfaces,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190111/,"The International Space Station (ISS) is a complex built environment physically isolated from Earth. Assessing the interplay between the microbial community of the ISS and its crew is important for preventing biomedical and structural complications for long term human spaceflight missions. In this study, we describe one crewmember’s microbial profile from body swabs of mouth, nose, ear, skin and saliva that were collected at eight different time points pre-, during and post-flight. Additionally, environmental surface samples from eight different habitable locations in the ISS were collected from two flights. Environmental samples from one flight were collected by the crewmember and samples from the next flight were collected after the crewmember departed. The microbial composition in both environment and crewmember samples was measured using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and processed using the Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit. Ordination of sample to sample distances showed that of the eight crew body sites analyzed, skin, nostril, and ear samples are more similar in microbial composition to the ISS surfaces than mouth and saliva samples; and that the microbial composition of the crewmember’s skin samples are more closely related to the ISS surface samples collected by the crewmember on the same flight than ISS surface samples collected by other crewmembers on different flights. In these collections, species alpha diversity in saliva samples appears to decrease during flight and rebound after returning to Earth. This is the first study to compare the ISS microbiome to a crewmember’s microbiome via shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We observed that the microbiome of the surfaces inside the ISS resemble those of the crew’s skin. These data support future crew and ISS microbial surveillance efforts and the design of preventive measures to maintain crew habitat onboard spacecraft destined for long term space travel.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5df9/7190111/91bdd49248ce/pone.0231838.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5df9/7190111/a3bf11802851/pone.0231838.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5df9/7190111/3c66287f0b67/pone.0231838.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5df9/7190111/9e66c63c6a8e/pone.0231838.g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5df9/7190111/948d1abf8b38/pone.0231838.g005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5df9/7190111/2aa969697cd4/pone.0231838.g006.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Sierra Nevada sweep: Metagenomic measurements of bioaerosols vertically distributed across the troposphere.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7382458/,"To explore how airborne microbial patterns change with height above the Earth’s surface, we flew NASA’s C-20A aircraft on two consecutive days in June 2018 along identical flight paths over the US Sierra Nevada mountain range at four different altitudes ranging from 10,000 ft to 40,000 ft. Bioaerosols were analyzed by metagenomic DNA sequencing and traditional culturing methods to characterize the composition and diversity of atmospheric samples compared to experimental controls. The relative abundance of taxa changed significantly at each altitude sampled, and the diversity profile shifted across the two sampling days, revealing a regional atmospheric microbiome that is dynamically changing. The most proportionally abundant microbial genera were Mycobacterium and Achromobacter at 10,000 ft; Stenotrophomonas and Achromobacter at 20,000 ft; Delftia and Pseudoperonospora at 30,000 ft; and Alcaligenes and Penicillium at 40,000 ft. Culture-based detections also identified viable Bacillus zhangzhouensis , Bacillus pumilus , and Bacillus spp. in the upper troposphere. To estimate bioaerosol dispersal, we developed a human exposure likelihood model (7-day forecast) using general aerosol characteristics and measured meteorological conditions. By coupling metagenomics to a predictive atmospheric model, we aim to set the stage for field campaigns that monitor global bioaerosol emissions and impacts.

Detection of Target Genes for Drug Repurposing to Treat Skeletal Muscle Atrophy in Mice Flown in Spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8953707/,"Skeletal muscle atrophy is a common condition in aging, diabetes, and in long duration spaceflights due to microgravity. This article investigates multi-modal gene disease and disease drug networks via link prediction algorithms to select drugs for repurposing to treat skeletal muscle atrophy. Key target genes that cause muscle atrophy in the left and right extensor digitorum longus muscle tissue, gastrocnemius, quadriceps, and the left and right soleus muscles are detected using graph theoretic network analysis, by mining the transcriptomic datasets collected from mice flown in spaceflight made available by GeneLab. We identified the top muscle atrophy gene regulators by the Pearson correlation and Bayesian Markov blanket method. The gene disease knowledge graph was constructed using the scalable precision medicine knowledge engine. We computed node embeddings, random walk measures from the networks. Graph convolutional networks, graph neural networks, random forest, and gradient boosting methods were trained using the embeddings, network features for predicting links and ranking top gene-disease associations for skeletal muscle atrophy. Drugs were selected and a disease drug knowledge graph was constructed. Link prediction methods were applied to the disease drug networks to identify top ranked drugs for therapeutic treatment of skeletal muscle atrophy. The graph convolution network performs best in link prediction based on receiver operating characteristic curves and prediction accuracies. The key genes involved in skeletal muscle atrophy are associated with metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. The drugs selected for repurposing using the graph convolution network method were nutrients, corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory medications, and others related to insulin.

Release of CD36-associated cell-free mitochondrial DNA and RNA as a hallmark of space environment response,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166646/,"A detailed understanding of how spaceflight affects human health is essential for long-term space exploration. Liquid biopsies allow for minimally-invasive multi-omics assessments that can resolve the molecular heterogeneity of internal tissues. Here, we report initial results from the JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome Study, a liquid biopsy study with six astronauts who resided on the International Space Station (ISS) for more than 120 days. Analysis of plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) collected before, during, and after spaceflight confirms previously reported mitochondrial dysregulation in space. Screening with 361 cell surface marker antibodies identifies a mitochondrial DNA-enriched fraction associated with the scavenger receptor CD36. RNA-sequencing of the CD36 fraction reveals tissue-enriched RNA species, suggesting the plasma mitochondrial components originated from various tissues. We compare our plasma cfRNA data to mouse plasma cfRNA data from a previous JAXA mission, which had used on-board artificial gravity, and discover a link between microgravity and the observed mitochondrial responses.

Increasing the number of unloading/reambulation cycles does not adversely impac body composition and lumbar bone mineral density but reduces tissue sensitivity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747666/,"A single exposure to hindlimb unloading leads to changes in body mass, body composition and bone, but the consequences of multiple exposures are not yet understood. Within a 18wk period, adult C57BL/6 male mice were exposed to one (1x-HLU), two (2x-HLU) or three (3x-HLU) cycles of 2 wk of hindlimb unloading (HLU) followed by 4 wk of reambulation (RA), or served as ambulatory age-matched controls. In vivo µCT longitudinally tracked changes in abdominal adipose and lean tissues, lumbar vertebral apparent volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area before and after the final HLU and RA cycle. Significant decreases in total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD were observed such that all unloaded animals reached similar values after the final unloading cycle. However, the magnitude of these losses diminished in mice undergoing their 2 nd or 3 rd HLU cycle. Irrespective of the number of HLU/RA cycles, total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD recovered and were no different from age-matched controls after the final RA period. In contrast, upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area was significantly lower than controls in all unloaded groups after the final RA period. These results suggest that tissues in the abdominal region are more resilient to multiple bouts of unloading and more amenable to recovery during reambulation than the peripheral musculoskeletal system.

Bone shaft bending strength index is unaffected by exercise and unloading in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4337661/,"Anthropologists frequently use the shaft bending strength index to infer the physical activity levels of humans living in the past from their lower limb bone remains. This index is typically calculated as the ratio of bone shaft second moments of area about orthogonal principal axes (i.e. I max / I min ). Individuals with high I max / I min values are inferred to have been very active, whereas individuals with low values are inferred to have been more sedentary. However, there is little direct evidence that activity has a causal and predictable effect on the shaft bending strength index. Here, we report the results of two experiments that were designed to test the model within which anthropologists commonly interpret the shaft bending strength index. In the first experiment, mice were treated daily with treadmill exercise for 1 month to simulate a high-activity lifestyle. In the second experiment, in an attempt to simulate a low-activity lifestyle, functional weight-bearing was removed from the hindlimbs of mice for 1 month. Femoral mid-shaft structure was determined with μCT. We found that while exercise resulted in significant enhancement of I max and I min compared with controls, it failed to significantly increase the I max / I min index. Similarly, stunted bone growth caused by unloading resulted in significantly diminished I max and I min compared with controls, but low activity did not lead to significantly decreased I max / I min compared with normal activity. Together, these results suggest that caution is required when the bone shaft bending strength index is used to reconstruct the activity levels of past humans.

"Cytoskeletal configuration modulates mechanically induced changes in mesenchymal stem cell osteogenesis, morphology, and stiffness.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5052530/,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) responding to mechanical cues generated by physical activity is critical for skeletal development and remodeling. Here, we utilized low intensity vibrations (LIV) as a physiologically relevant mechanical signal and hypothesized that the confined cytoskeletal configuration imposed by 2D culture will enable human bone marrow MSCs (hBMSC) to respond more robustly when LIV is applied in-plane (horizontal-LIV) rather than out-of-plane (vertical-LIV). All LIV signals enhanced hBMSC proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and upregulated genes associated with cytoskeletal structure. The cellular response was more pronounced at higher frequencies (100 Hz vs 30 Hz) and when applied in the horizontal plane. Horizontal but not vertical LIV realigned the cell cytoskeleton, culminating in increased cell stiffness. Our results show that applying very small oscillatory motions within the primary cell attachment plane, rather than perpendicular to it, amplifies the cell’s response to LIV, ostensibly facilitating a more effective transfer of intracellular forces. Transcriptional and structural changes in particular with horizontal LIV, together with the strong frequency dependency of the signal, emphasize the importance of intracellular cytoskeletal configuration in sensing and responding to high-frequency mechanical signals at low intensities.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) residing in bone marrow provide regenerative capacity for bone, replacing and reinforcing the skeleton 1 . The ability of MSC to respond to mechanical cues generated during functional loading is critical for musculoskeletal health. At the cellular level, bone can sense and adapt to daily loading events that induce matrix deformations 2 , 3 , accelerations 4 , 5 , muscle activity 6 , 7 , fluid flow 8 , 9 , or changes in intramedullary pressure 10 , 11 . Loading events do not necessarily have to be large in magnitude to be sensed by cells. In contrast to the low signal frequency of large mechanical forces applied to the skeleton during rigorous exercise, exposure to high-frequency low intensity vibration (LIV) may enhance musculoskeletal function 12 , as LIV may decrease MSC adipogenesis 13 and adipose tissue 14 , augment bone formation 15 , increase osteogenic lineage output from MSC 16 , or increase muscle size 17 .
Despite their physiologic relevance 18 , little is known about how very small mechanical signals such as LIV are perceived at the cellular level to control output 19 . LIV creates a complex local loading environment that is modulated by many factors including LIV frequency 20 , LIV amplitude 21 , or viscosity of the surrounding fluid 22 . In contrast to high-impact exercise (e.g., jumping) which induces peak bone strains in the extracellular matrix ranging from 1500 to 3500 με 2 , 23 , LIV induces matrix strains of less than 50 με in cortical bone 21 , a deformation unlikely to be large enough to be perceived as a relevant mechanical signal 24 , 25 . Not surprisingly, in vivo pre-clinical studies demonstrated that bone’s response to LIV is largely independent of strain generated in the matrix 26 , 27 . Computational studies indicated that LIV (30–100 Hz, 0.1–1 g) can generate considerable fluid shear at trabecular surfaces in contact with bone marrow 22 , 28 . In vitro studies, however, could not find a link between LIV induced fluid shear stress magnitude and the cellular response 16 , 29 , 30 .
As an alternative to previously suggested mechanotransduction mechanisms such as matrix deformation or fluid shear, it is possible that cells have mechanisms that allow them to respond to dynamic acceleration rather than matrix deformations per se 5 , 31 . Some aspects of the cellular LIV response, such as increased expression of cytoskeletal proteins 16 , show a positive correlation with the rate of LIV acceleration 31 . Further, LIV-induced signaling specifically requires mechanical coupling between the actin cytoskeleton and nucleus facilitated by the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex 13 , a structural requirement not shared by the signaling events initiated by matrix deformation 32 . These data suggest the possibility that the nucleus, a relatively stiffer and denser organelle mechanically integrated into the cytoskeleton 29 , may play a role in LIV-signaling through transmitting acceleration to the cell cytoskeleton from inside the cell and thus generating internal cellular stresses through motions relative to the cell cytoskeleton and cell membrane. Even though the sub-cellular localization of these LIV-induced signaling events remains to be uncovered, LINC complexes may also play a role in activating force-responsive signaling event within the nucleus via exerting forces through their connection with the cytoskeleton 33 .
If indeed LIV activates mechano-signaling pathways through the connectivity between nucleus and cell cytoskeleton, the efficacy of LIV should be dependent on structural cell configuration as both cytoskeletal pre-stress 34 , controlling the degree of mechanical coupling between nucleus and actin cytoskeleton 35 , and spatial configuration of actin filaments 36 may play a role in transmittal of forces. Thus, in a 2D cell culture system that confines the cell architecture into a single plane with a forced apical-basal polarity 37 , it is possible that the application of horizontal accelerations is perceived differently by the cell from vertical accelerations as cell configurational differences relative to the principal motion axis will generate different cellular stresses.
To answer this question, we applied LIV in 2D cell culture either horizontally or vertically with respect to the plane of cell attachment and quantified outcome variables including proliferation, differentiation, gene expression, and cytoskeletal structure/stiffness of human bone marrow MSC (hBMSC). We hypothesized that cells would be more responsive to horizontal vibrations as they have the potential to engage the nuclear-cytoskeletal structure more effectively in its 2D horizontal plane. We also hypothesized that the relative importance of LIV amplitude and frequency in hBMSC’s mechanoresponse would be independent of LIV direction.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-scirep.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2cf9/5052530/ce14696f0369/srep34791-f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2cf9/5052530/da9d6ba9aef6/srep34791-f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2cf9/5052530/bdff42c60284/srep34791-f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2cf9/5052530/3e8b6ca9579a/srep34791-f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2cf9/5052530/c10cd2a4f02b/srep34791-f5.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Genetic and tissue level muscle-bone interactions during unloading and reambulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5114340/,"Little is known about interactions between muscle and bone during the removal and application of mechanical signals. Here, we applied 3wk of hindlimb unloading followed by 3wk of reambulation to a genetically heterogeneous population of 352 adult mice and tested the hypothesis that changes in muscle are associated with changes in bone at the level of the tissue and the genome. During unloading and relative to normally ambulating control mice, most mice lost muscle and cortical bone with large variability across the population. During reambulation, individual mice regained bone and muscle at different rates. Across mice, changes in muscle and trabecular/cortical bone were not correlated to each other during unloading or reambulation. For unloading, we found one significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for muscle area and five QTLs for cortical bone without overlap between mechano-sensitive muscle and cortical bone QTLs (but some overlap between muscle and trabecular QTLs). The low correlations between morphological changes in muscle and bone, together with the largely distinct genetic regulation of the response indicate that the premise of a muscle-bone unit that co-adjusts its size during (un)loading may need to be reassessed.

Osteocyte apoptosis caused by hindlimb unloading is required to trigger osteocyte RANKL production and subsequent resorption of cortical and trabecular bone in mice femurs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5488280/,"Osteocyte apoptosis is essential to activate bone remodeling in response to fatigue microdamage and estrogen withdrawal, such that apoptosis inhibition in vivo prevents the onset of osteoclastic resorption. Osteocyte apoptosis has also been spatially linked to bone resorption owing to disuse, but whether apoptosis plays a similar controlling role is unclear. We, therefore, 1) evaluated the spatial and temporal effects of disuse from hindlimb unloading (HLU) on osteocyte apoptosis, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) expression, bone resorption, and loss in mouse femora, and 2) tested whether osteocyte apoptosis was required to activate osteoclastic activity in cortical and trabecular bone by treating animals subjected to HLU with the pan-caspase apoptosis inhibitor, QVD (quinolyl-valyl-O-methylaspartyl-[-2,6-difluorophenoxy]-methylketone). Immunohistochemistry was used to identify apoptotic and RANKL-producing osteocytes in femoral diaphysis and distal trabecular bone, and μCT was used to determine the extent of trabecular bone loss owing to HLU. In both cortical and trabecular bone, 5 days of HLU increased osteocyte apoptosis significantly (3- and 4-fold, respectively, p < 0.05 versus Ctrl). At day 14, the apoptotic osteocyte number in femoral cortices declined to near control levels but remained elevated in trabeculae (3-fold versus Ctrl, p < 0.05). The number of osteocytes producing RANKL in both bone compartments was also significantly increased at day 5 of HLU (>1.5-fold versus Ctrl, p <0.05) and further increased by day 14. Increases in osteocyte apoptosis and RANKL production preceded increases in bone resorption at both endocortical and trabecular surfaces. QVD completely inhibited not only the HLU-triggered increases in osteocyte apoptosis but also RANKL production and activation of bone resorption at both sites. Finally, μCT studies revealed that apoptosis inhibition completely prevented the trabecular bone loss caused by HLU. Together these data indicate that osteocyte apoptosis plays a central and controlling role in triggering osteocyte RANKL production and the activation of new resorption leading to bone loss in disuse.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-nihpa.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9ed0/5488280/f2a6dcb2c644/nihms866074f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9ed0/5488280/caf6ac08d635/nihms866074f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9ed0/5488280/73091499f7ee/nihms866074f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9ed0/5488280/3639518c84d8/nihms866074f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9ed0/5488280/5be86a97a385/nihms866074f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9ed0/5488280/dc01c0f9bb5c/nihms866074f6.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9ed0/5488280/b9819fda1f5f/nihms866074f7.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9ed0/5488280/c9b3f9d06818/nihms866074f8.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Differential Single Cell Responses of Embryonic Stem Cells Versus Embryoid Bodies to Gravity Mechanostimulation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9293686/,"The forces generated by gravity have shaped life on Earth and impact gene expression and morphogenesis during early development. Conversely, disuse on Earth or during spaceflight, reduces normal mechanical loading of organisms, resulting in altered cell and tissue function. Although gravity mechanical loading in adult mammals is known to promote increased cell proliferation and differentiation, little is known about how distinct cell types respond to gravity mechanostimulation during early development. In this study we sought to understand, with single cell RNA-sequencing resolution, how a 60-min pulse of 50 g hypergravity (HG)/5 kPa hydrostatic pressure, influences transcriptomic regulation of developmental processes in the embryoid body (EB) model. Our study included both day-9 EBs and progenitor mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with or without the HG pulse. Single cell t-distributed stochastic neighbor mapping shows limited transcriptome shifts in response to the HG pulse in either ESCs or EBs; this pulse however, induces greater positional shifts in EB mapping compared to ESCs, indicating the influence of mechanotransduction is more pronounced in later states of cell commitment within the developmental program. More specifically, HG resulted in upregulation of self-renewal and angiogenesis genes in ESCs, while in EBs, HG loading was associated with upregulation of Gene Ontology-pathways for multicellular development, mechanical signal transduction, and DNA damage repair. Cluster transcriptome analysis of the EBs show HG promotes maintenance of transitory cell phenotypes in early development; including EB cluster co-expression of markers for progenitor, post-implant epiblast, and primitive endoderm phenotypes with HG pulse but expression exclusivity in the non-pulsed clusters. Pseudotime analysis identified three branching cell types susceptible to HG induction of cell fate decisions. In totality, this study provides novel evidence that ESC maintenance and EB development can be regulated by gravity mechanostimulation and that stem cells committed to a differentiation program are more sensitive to gravity-induced changes to their transcriptome.

Macrophages inhibit Aspergillus fumigatus germination and neutrophil-mediated fungal killing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6091969/,"In immunocompromised individuals, Aspergillus fumigatus causes invasive fungal disease that is often difficult to treat. Exactly how immune mechanisms control A . fumigatus in immunocompetent individuals remains unclear. Here, we use transparent zebrafish larvae to visualize and quantify neutrophil and macrophage behaviors in response to different A . fumigatus strains. We find that macrophages form dense clusters around spores, establishing a protective niche for fungal survival. Macrophages exert these protective effects by inhibiting fungal germination, thereby inhibiting subsequent neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil-mediated killing. Germination directly drives fungal clearance as faster-growing CEA10-derived strains are killed better in vivo than slower-growing Af293-derived strains. Additionally, a CEA10 pyrG -deficient strain with impaired germination is cleared less effectively by neutrophils. Host inflammatory activation through Myd88 is required for killing of a CEA10-derived strain but not sufficient for killing of an Af293-derived strain, further demonstrating the role of fungal-intrinsic differences in the ability of a host to clear an infection. Altogether, we describe a new role for macrophages in the persistence of A . fumigatus and highlight the ability of different A . fumigatus strains to adopt diverse modes of virulence.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plospath.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a559/6091969/7052f648e2a7/ppat.1007229.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a559/6091969/ca801a7fc73f/ppat.1007229.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a559/6091969/aa00c946459d/ppat.1007229.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a559/6091969/044eb876f0df/ppat.1007229.g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a559/6091969/1fe578b8eb93/ppat.1007229.g005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a559/6091969/b6cb825c4e72/ppat.1007229.g006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a559/6091969/da3c4c689671/ppat.1007229.g007.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a559/6091969/818d54f6e2a1/ppat.1007229.g008.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a559/6091969/b80fba4d3c07/ppat.1007229.g009.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a559/6091969/45352aedd8b8/ppat.1007229.g010.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

Regulation of hemocytes in Drosophila requires dappled cytochrome b5.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3092937/,"A major category of mutant hematopoietic phenotypes in Drosophila is melanotic tumors or nodules, which consist of abnormal and overproliferated blood cells, similar to granulomas. Our analyses of the melanotic mutant dappled have revealed a novel type of gene involved in blood cell regulation. The dappled gene is an essential gene that encodes cytochrome b5, a conserved hemoprotein that participates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and pathways. Viable mutations of dappled cause melanotic nodules and hemocyte misregulation during both hematopoietic waves of development. The sexes are similarly affected, but hemocyte number is different in females and males of both mutants and wild type. Additionally, initial tests show that curcumin enhances the dappled melanotic phenotype and establish screening of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds as a route for analysis of cytochrome b5 function. Overall, dappled provides a tractable genetic model for cytochrome b5, which has been difficult to study in higher organisms.

A novel phototropic response to red light is revealed in microgravity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5748516/,"Main conclusion Blue-light positive phototropism in roots is masked by gravity and revealed in conditions of microgravity. In addition, the magnitude of red-light positive phototropic curvature is correlated to the magnitude of gravity.
Due to their sessile nature, plants utilize environmental cues to grow and respond to their surroundings. Two of these cues, light and gravity, play a substantial role in plant orientation and directed growth movements (tropisms). However, very little is currently known about the interaction between light- (phototropic) and gravity (gravitropic)-mediated growth responses. Utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System on board the International Space Station, we investigated the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in three Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes, Landsberg wild type, as well as mutants of phytochrome A and phytochrome B. Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1 g . A novel positive blue-light phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, and this response was attenuated at 0.1 g . In addition, a red-light pretreatment of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in response to blue illumination. In addition, a positive phototropic response of roots was observed when exposed to red light, and a decrease in response was gradual and correlated with the increase in gravity. The positive red-light phototropic curvature of hypocotyls when exposed to red light was also confirmed. Both red-light and blue-light phototropic responses were also shown to be affected by directional light intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a positive blue-light phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots, as well as the first description of the relationship between these phototropic responses in fractional or reduced gravities.

Light and gravity signals synergize in modulating plant development,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4211383/,"Tropisms are growth-mediated plant movements that help plants to respond to changes in environmental stimuli. The availability of water and light, as well as the presence of a constant gravity vector, are all environmental stimuli that plants sense and respond to via directed growth movements (tropisms). The plant response to gravity (gravitropism) and the response to unidirectional light (phototropism) have long been shown to be interconnected growth phenomena. Here, we discuss the similarities in these two processes, as well as the known molecular mechanisms behind the tropistic responses. We also highlight research done in a microgravity environment in order to decouple two tropisms through experiments carried out in the absence of a significant unilateral gravity vector. In addition, alteration of gravity, especially the microgravity environment, and light irradiation produce important effects on meristematic cells, the undifferentiated, highly proliferating, totipotent cells which sustain plant development. Microgravity produces the disruption of meristematic competence, i.e., the decoupling of cell proliferation and cell growth, affecting the regulation of the cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis. Light irradiation, especially red light, mediated by phytochromes, has an activating effect on these processes. Phytohormones, particularly auxin, also are key mediators in these alterations. Upcoming experiments on the International Space Station will clarify some of the mechanisms and molecular players of the plant responses to these environmental signals involved in tropisms and the cell cycle.

A novel blue-light phototropic response is revealed in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana in microgravity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5748516/,"Main conclusion Blue-light positive phototropism in roots is masked by gravity and revealed in conditions of microgravity. In addition, the magnitude of red-light positive phototropic curvature is correlated to the magnitude of gravity.
Due to their sessile nature, plants utilize environmental cues to grow and respond to their surroundings. Two of these cues, light and gravity, play a substantial role in plant orientation and directed growth movements (tropisms). However, very little is currently known about the interaction between light- (phototropic) and gravity (gravitropic)-mediated growth responses. Utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System on board the International Space Station, we investigated the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in three Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes, Landsberg wild type, as well as mutants of phytochrome A and phytochrome B. Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1 g . A novel positive blue-light phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, and this response was attenuated at 0.1 g . In addition, a red-light pretreatment of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in response to blue illumination. In addition, a positive phototropic response of roots was observed when exposed to red light, and a decrease in response was gradual and correlated with the increase in gravity. The positive red-light phototropic curvature of hypocotyls when exposed to red light was also confirmed. Both red-light and blue-light phototropic responses were also shown to be affected by directional light intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a positive blue-light phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots, as well as the first description of the relationship between these phototropic responses in fractional or reduced gravities.

RNAseq analysis of the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to fractional gravity under blue-light stimulation during spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6889863/,"Introduction: Traveling to nearby extraterrestrial objects having a reduced gravity level (partial gravity) compared to Earth’s gravity is becoming a realistic objective for space agencies. The use of plants as part of life support systems will require a better understanding of the interactions among plant growth responses including tropisms, under partial gravity conditions.
Materials and Methods: Here, we present results from our latest space experiments on the ISS, in which seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were germinated, and seedlings grew for six days under different gravity levels, namely micro- g , several intermediate partial- g levels, and 1 g , and were subjected to irradiation with blue light for the last 48 h. RNA was extracted from 20 samples for subsequent RNAseq analysis. Transcriptomic analysis was performed using the HISAT2-Stringtie-DESeq pipeline. Differentially expressed genes were further characterized for global responses using the GEDI tool, gene networks and for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment.
Results: Differential gene expression analysis revealed only one differentially expressed gene (AT4G21560, VPS28-1 a vacuolar protein) across all gravity conditions using FDR correction (q < 0.05). However, the same 14 genes appeared differentially expressed when comparing either micro- g , low- g level (< 0.1 g ) or the Moon g -level with 1 g control conditions. Apart from these 14-shared genes, the number of differentially expressed genes was similar in microgravity and the Moon g -level and increased in the intermediate g -level (< 0.1 g ), but it was then progressively reduced as the difference with the Earth gravity became smaller. The GO groups were differentially affected at each g -level: light and photosynthesis GO under microgravity, genes belonged to general stress, chemical and hormone responses under low- g , and a response related to cell wall and membrane structure and function under the Moon g -level.
Discussion: Transcriptional analyses of plants under blue light stimulation suggests that root blue-light phototropism may be enough to reduce the gravitational stress response caused by the lack of gravitropism in microgravity. Competition among tropisms induces an intense perturbation at the micro- g level, which shows an extensive stress response that is progressively attenuated. Our results show a major effect on cell wall/membrane remodeling (detected at the interval from the Moon to Mars gravity), which can be potentially related to graviresistance mechanisms.

Comparison of Microgravity Analogs to Spaceflight in Studies of Plant Growth and Development,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6908503/,"Life on Earth has evolved under the influence of gravity. This force has played an important role in shaping development and morphology from the molecular level to the whole organism. Although aquatic life experiences reduced gravity effects, land plants have evolved under a 1- g environment. Understanding gravitational effects requires changing the magnitude of this force. One method of eliminating gravity'’s influence is to enter into a free-fall orbit around the planet, thereby achieving a balance between centripetal force of gravity and the centrifugal force of the moving object. This balance is often mistakenly referred to as microgravity, but is best described as weightlessness. In addition to actually compensating gravity, instruments such as clinostats, random-positioning machines (RPM), and magnetic levitation devices have been used to eliminate effects of constant gravity on plant growth and development. However, these platforms do not reduce gravity but constantly change its direction. Despite these fundamental differences, there are few studies that have investigated the comparability between these platforms and weightlessness. Here, we provide a review of the strengths and weaknesses of these analogs for the study of plant growth and development compared to spaceflight experiments. We also consider reduced or partial gravity effects via spaceflight and analog methods. While these analogs are useful, the fidelity of the results relative to spaceflight depends on biological parameters and environmental conditions that cannot be simulated in ground-based studies.

Conducting plant experiments in space and on the Moon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10764921/,"Understanding the response of plants to varied gravitational conditions is vital for developing effective food production in space bioregenerative life support systems. This study examines the impact of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphological responses of Wolffia globosa (commonly known as “ water lentils ” or “ duckweed ”), assessing its potential as a space crop. Although an experiment testing the effect of simulated microgravity on Wolffia globosa has been previously conducted, for the first time, we investigated the effect of multiple gravity levels on the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa plants. The plant responses to simulated microgravity, simulated partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity environments were evaluated using random positioning machines and the large-diameter centrifuge. As hypothesized, we observed a slight reaction to different gravitational levels in the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa. The relative growth rates (RGR) of plants subjected to simulated microgravity and partial gravity were reduced when compared to those in other gravity levels. The morphological analysis revealed differences in plant dimensions and frond length-to-width ratios under diverse gravity conditions. Our findings showed that Wolffia globosa is responsive to gravitational changes, with its growth and morphological adaptations being slightly influenced by varying gravitational environments. As for other crop species, growth was reduced by the microgravity conditions; however, RGR remained substantial at 0.33 a day. In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration missions.

Red light enhances plant adaptation to spaceflight and Mars g-levels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9605285/,"Understanding how plants respond and adapt to extraterrestrial conditions is essential for space exploration initiatives. Deleterious effects of the space environment on plant development have been reported, such as the unbalance of cell growth and proliferation in the root meristem, or gene expression reprogramming. However, plants are capable of surviving and completing the seed-to-seed life cycle under microgravity. A key research challenge is to identify environmental cues, such as light, which could compensate the negative effects of microgravity. Understanding the crosstalk between light and gravity sensing in space was the major objective of the NASA-ESA Seedling Growth series of spaceflight experiments (2013–2018). Different g -levels were used, with special attention to micro- g , Mars- g , and Earth- g . In spaceflight seedlings illuminated for 4 days with a white light photoperiod and then photostimulated with red light for 2 days, transcriptomic studies showed, first, that red light partially reverted the gene reprogramming induced by microgravity, and that the combination of microgravity and photoactivation was not recognized by seedlings as stressful. Two mutant lines of the nucleolar protein nucleolin exhibited differential requirements in response to red light photoactivation. This observation opens the way to directed-mutagenesis strategies in crop design to be used in space colonization. Further transcriptomic studies at different g -levels showed elevated plastid and mitochondrial genome expression in microgravity, associated with disturbed nucleus–organelle communication, and the upregulation of genes encoding auxin and cytokinin hormonal pathways. At the Mars g -level, genes of hormone pathways related to stress response were activated, together with some transcription factors specifically related to acclimation, suggesting that seedlings grown in partial- g are able to acclimate by modulating genome expression in routes related to space-environment-associated stress.

EUK-134 ameliorates nNOS¬µ translocation and skeletal muscle fiber atrophy during short-term mechanical unloading.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3962621/,"Reduced mechanical loading during bedrest, spaceflight, and casting, causes rapid morphological changes in skeletal muscle: fiber atrophy and reduction of slow-twitch fibers. An emerging signaling event in response to unloading is the translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSμ) from the sarcolemma to the cytosol. We used EUK-134, a cell-permeable mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase, to test the role of redox signaling in nNOSμ translocation and muscle fiber atrophy as a result of short-term (54 h) hindlimb unloading. Fischer-344 rats were divided into ambulatory control, hindlimb-unloaded (HU), and hindlimb-unloaded + EUK-134 (HU-EUK) groups. EUK-134 mitigated the unloading-induced phenotype, including muscle fiber atrophy and muscle fiber-type shift from slow to fast. nNOSμ immunolocalization at the sarcolemma of the soleus was reduced with HU, while nNOSμ protein content in the cytosol increased with unloading. Translocation of nNOS from the sarcolemma to cytosol was virtually abolished by EUK-134. EUK-134 also mitigated dephosphorylation at Thr-32 of FoxO3a during HU. Hindlimb unloading elevated oxidative stress (4-hydroxynonenal) and increased sarcolemmal localization of Nox2 subunits gp91phox (Nox2) and p47phox, effects normalized by EUK-134. Thus, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that oxidative stress triggers nNOSμ translocation from the sarcolemma and FoxO3a dephosphorylation as an early event during mechanical unloading. Thus, redox signaling may serve as a biological switch for nNOS to initiate morphological changes in skeletal muscle fibers.

skeletal muscle is a highly specialized and adaptable mesodermic tissue capable of rapid remodeling in response to changes in mechanical loading and stretch ( 28 , 38 ). Transmittance and detection of loading in skeletal muscle are paramount in regulating differentiation, cell growth, and protein turnover. The ability to sense and relay loading (i.e., mechanotransduction) is, in part, performed by proteins adjacent to and spanning cell membranes (i.e., sarcolemma) in skeletal muscle ( 47 ). Mechanical unloading that occurs with limb casting, splinting, bed rest, and spaceflight, elicits a substantial loss of force-generating capacity, linked to a diminishment in muscle fiber cross-sectional area or atrophy ( 12 , 23 ). The unloading phenotype also includes a shift of a portion of skeletal muscle fibers from slow-twitch to fast-twitch ( 12 ). Muscle atrophy that occurs with unloading is coupled to a net loss of contractile proteins, a function of increased protein degradation combined with a decrease in protein synthesis ( 12 , 23 ). Recent studies emphasize the importance of proteolytic pathways, including ubiquitin proteasome, calpains, autophagy, and caspase-3 in triggering the early stages of atrophy ( 4 , 10 , 11 , 26 , 34 , 35 , 39 ). For example, elevation of ubiquitin ligases with unloading is initiated via dephosphorylation of FoxO3a and activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ( 26 , 34 , 42 ).
Elegant experiments by Suzuki et al. ( 42 ) ushered in a new paradigm, whereby disassembly of skeletal muscle in response to mechanical unloading is accelerated by translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) from the sarcolemma to the sarcoplasm. The mu (μ)-splice variant of nNOS is a key signaling protein located in the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) of skeletal muscle ( 29 , 42 ), anchored through binding of a PDX motif at its NH 2 terminus to α and β-syntrophins, and, thus, to dystrophin and dystrobrevin ( 13 , 29 ). Fourteen days of mechanical unloading of the soleus resulted in movement of nNOSμ to the sarcoplasm, where nNOSμ directly led to dephosphorylation of FoxO3a at Thr-32, and stimulated ubiquitin ligases and atrophy ( 42 ). Interestingly, the loss of nNOSμ from the DGC also occurs in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), where it may exacerbate further disruption of the DGC proteins, thus increasing susceptibility to muscle damage and inflammation ( 19 , 43 ). Furthermore, knockout of the nNOSμ gene has been recently shown to elicit myopathy and a reduction in contractile force ( 29 ). In addition, new data from Ito et al. ( 15 ) demonstrate that nNOS activation of the NADPH oxidase isoform Nox4 contributes to hypertrophy when skeletal muscle is overloaded. These data suggest in total that nNOSμ may serve as an effector of dynamic changes in mechanical loading, regardless of whether loading is increased or decreased.
While the mechanisms underlying translocation of nNOS are unknown, increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent oxidative stress is possible. For example, oxidative stress from NADPH oxidase and possibly mitochondrial sources play a role in damage in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, where nNOS that is lost from the sarcolemma contributes directly to pathology ( 17 , 45 ). Elevated skeletal muscle ROS from mitochondrial sources during mechanical unloading has been reported by Powers and colleagues ( 27 ). Recent data suggest that the Nox2 isoform of NADPH oxidase, a gp91phox containing NADPH oxidase, is important in stretch-induced Ca 2+ dyshomeostasis and damage ( 17 , 45 ). NADPH oxidase is a family of membrane-bound oxidoreductases in nonphagocytic and phagocytic cells that produce superoxide anions (O 2 ·− ) in response to mechanical strain, hypoxia, and damage ( 17 ). Elevated oxidative stress from mitochondria and possibly Nox2 could result in a loss or translocation of nNOS from the sarcolemma ( 21 , 41 ).
Therefore, we hypothesized that translocation of nNOSμ during an early stage of mechanical unloading would be linked to changes in oxidative stress and downstream dephosphorylation of FoxO3a at Thr-32. We further postulated that attenuation of oxidative stress would mitigate translocation of nNOS from the sarcolemmal region and significantly ameliorate two predominant phenotypic changes that begin early in mechanical unloading: 1 ) muscle fiber atrophy and 2 ) fiber-type shift from slow to fast. Previous antioxidant supplementation studies using nonspecific scavengers have yielded inconsistent findings in reducing morphological responses to unloading ( 3 , 6 , 20 ). In contrast, transfection of the antioxidant enzyme catalase yielded significant protection against atrophy ( 9 ). To test the importance of redox signaling, we used a novel cell-permeable, saline-manganese compound (EUK-134), which mimics the catalytic function of superoxide dismutase (SOD) coupled with catalase. In addition, to target redox signaling that is active early in the unloading process, and, therefore, involvement in initiation of atrophy, we chose a 54-h period of hindlimb unloading when oxidative stress is peaking ( 4 ).","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-ajpregu.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ae47/3962621/4c90d41d3977/zh60061484110010.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ae47/3962621/f76504ef92a6/zh60061484110001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ae47/3962621/8a844b0d1867/zh60061484110002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ae47/3962621/77790a68e3bd/zh60061484110003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ae47/3962621/f12d65bea115/zh60061484110004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ae47/3962621/1e935b508948/zh60061484110005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ae47/3962621/c596e32b1dbe/zh60061484110006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ae47/3962621/f3c25a93767d/zh60061484110007.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ae47/3962621/c871e3ee4450/zh60061484110008.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ae47/3962621/1da03ba59f39/zh60061484110009.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
MnSOD Overexpression Reduces Fibrosis and Pro-Apoptotic Signaling in the Aging Mouse Heart,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4462657/,"Contractility of the heart is impaired with advancing age via mechanical remodeling, as myocytes are lost through apoptosis and collagenous fibers accumulate. Exercise training confers protection against fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We recently reported that exercise training elevates Mn isoform of superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in the aging heart, concomitant with reduction in oxidative stress and fibrosis. Here, we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of MnSOD would be causal in protection against fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart. Hearts were extracted from young (8 months) wild-type, young mice overexpressing the Sod2 (MnSOD) gene, old (28 months) wild-type, and old transgenic mice. Left ventricle MnSOD protein levels were elevated in young mice overexpressing the Sod2 (MnSOD) gene and old transgenic mice. MnSODTg mice exhibited lower oxidative stress (total hydroperoxides, 4-hydroxynonenal, and 8-isoprostane) in the old group. Age-related cardiac remodeling and fibrosis was mitigated in MnSOD Tg mice with reductions in extramyocyte space (−65%), collagen-I, and transforming growth factor-β. Pro-apoptotic markers Bax (−38%) and caspase-3 cleavage (−41%) were reduced and apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive nuclei, DNA laddering) was mitigated in MnSOD Tg hearts compared with old wild-type. We conclude that MnSOD elevation is indeed protective against oxidative stress, fibrosis, and apoptosis in the aging heart.

A ging reduces cardiac function due to impaired Ca 2+ homeostasis ( 1 , 2 ) and progressive structural remodeling. Age-related remodeling includes the loss of cardiac myocytes, a product of increased apoptosis and necrosis as well as reduced replacement by progenitor cells ( 3–5 ). Indeed, the loss of cardiac myocytes increases exponentially with advancing age in the heart, although the impact may be gender-dependent ( 5 , 6 ). For example, aging resulted in approximately 30% reduction in the number of cardiac myocytes in 70-year-old man ( 7 ). In addition, remaining cardiac myocytes experience reactive hypertrophy, and there is an accumulation of connective tissue (ie, fibrosis) ( 8 ). Increased fibrotic tissue reduces cardiac filling and enhances the risk of chronic heart failure ( 2 ).
Previously, we reported that treadmill exercise training reduced age-induced apoptosis and remodeling in the rat heart ( 4 ). In a follow-up study ( 5 ), we reported that exercise training reduced collagenous fibrosis that was associated with aging. Collagen-I and upstream regulatory proteins tissue inhibition of metalloproteinase-1 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) were lower in the hearts of exercise trained rats. Treadmill exercise training also upregulated the mitochondrial cell protective Mn isoform of superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and reduced oxidative stress in the aging heart ( 9 ). However, the causal relationship between elevation of MnSOD in the aging heart and reduction in fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart is unknown.
MnSOD is an essential antioxidant enzyme located in the mitochondrial matrix, protecting proteins, lipids, and DNA. MnSOD catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide anion (O 2 • − ) produced in the mitochondrial inner membrane to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) ( 10 , 11 ). MnSOD has been shown to confer cardioprotection in a number of models. For example, homozygous MnSOD ( Sod2 −/− ) knockout mice exhibit impaired mitochondrial enzyme and high susceptibility to oxidative mitochondrial injury ( 12 , 13 ). Furthermore, Sod2 −/− mice have enlarged hearts with dilated left ventricles (LV), leading to early postnatal mortality ( 12 ). In addition, the heterozygous MnSOD ( Sod2 − /+ ) knockout mouse expresses a phenotype characterized by impaired mitochondrial enzyme activity and respiration ( 14 ). Moreover, the Sod2 −/+ mouse has a higher probability of permeability transition pore opening ( 15 ) and oxidative damage to mitochondria ( 16 ) than wild-types (WT). In contrast, overexpression of MnSOD in transgenic mice appears to protect against oxidative stress, mitochondrial oxidative capacity, apoptosis, and in liver, brain, and skeletal muscle ( 10 , 17–19 ).
Exercise enhances stress response including enhancement of MnSOD ( 20 ), heat-shock proteins ( 19 ), and insulin-like growth factor-1 ( 1 , 3 ). Indeed, upregulation of stress proteins may abrogate apoptosis and remodeling in the heart. Elevation of MnSOD is an attractive protection-mechanism of habitual exercise against fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart because inducibility of MnSOD by exercise training is retained with age ( 9 ). Exercise may also attenuate redox-sensitive inflammatory cytokines ( 21 ), which stimulate cardiac remodeling.
A primary source of elevated oxidative stress in the aging heart is believed to be complexes I and III of mitochondrial electron transport chain of the inner mitochondrial membrane ( 22 ). Furthermore, elevation of mitochondrial oxidative stress is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction ( 22 , 23 ). Indeed, age-related elevation of oxidative stress has been linked to pro-apoptotic proteins (eg, Bax, Bad, Bid) resulting in increased permeability transition pore opening and subsequent activation of caspases-9 and -3 ( 21 ).
Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of MnSOD ( Sod2 Tg) would attenuate age-related remodeling. Specifically, we postulated that old MnSOD Tg would exhibit significantly lower levels of cardiac oxidative stress, fibrotic markers (collagen-I, TGF-β), and apoptosis (Bax, caspase-3 cleavage, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling [TUNEL]-positive staining, DNA fragmentation) compared with old WT.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-gerona.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/759a/4462657/bbf1bc9d9597/gerona_glu090_f0001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/759a/4462657/0a6df3f7ec65/gerona_glu090_f0002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/759a/4462657/37e3ed2b7c77/gerona_glu090_f0003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/759a/4462657/b856d213c2ef/gerona_glu090_f0004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/759a/4462657/0635fd961519/gerona_glu090_f0005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/759a/4462657/c7eec191fbdd/gerona_glu090_f0006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/759a/4462657/bca7afd17ca3/gerona_glu090_f0007.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Lifelong wheel running exercise and mild caloric restriction attenuate nuclear EndoG in the aging plantaris muscle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5026643/,"Apoptosis plays an important role in atrophy and sarcopenia in skeletal muscle. Recent evidence suggests that insufficient heat shock proteins (HSPs) may contribute to apoptosis and muscle wasting. In addition, long-term caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong wheel running exercise (WR) with CR provide significant protection against caspase-dependent apoptosis and sarcopenia. Caspase-independent mediators (endonuclease G: EndoG; apoptosis-inducing factor: AIF) of apoptosis are also linked to muscles wasting with disuse and aging. However, the efficacy of CR and WR with CR to attenuate caspase-independent apoptosis and preserve HSPs in aging skeletal muscle are unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that CR and WR with CR would ameliorate age-induced elevation of EndoG and AIF while protecting HSP27 and HSP70 levels in the plantaris. Male Fischer-344 rats were divided into 4 groups at 11 weeks: ad libitum feeding until 6 mo. (YAL); fed ad libitum until 24 mo. old (OAL); 8%CR to 24 mo. (OCR); WR + 8%CR to 24 mo. (OExCR). Nuclear EndoG levels were significantly higher in OAL (+153%) than in YAL, while CR (−38%) and WR with CR (−46%) significantly attenuated age-induced increment in nuclear EndoG. HSP27 (−63%) protein content and phosphorylation at Ser82 (−49%) were significantly lower in OAL than in YAL, while HSP27 protein content was significantly higher in OCR (+136%) and OExCR (+155%) and p-HSP27 (+254%) was significantly higher in OExCR compared with OAL, respectively. In contrast, AIF and HSP70 were unaltered by CR or WR with CR in aging muscle. These data indicate that CR and WR with CR attenuate age-associated upregulation of EndoG translocation in the nucleus, potentially involved with HSP27 signaling.

Age-related alterations in the sarcolemmal environment are attenuated by lifelong caloric restriction and voluntary exercise.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5026642/,"Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, referred to as sarcopenia, is mitigated by lifelong calorie restriction as well as exercise. In aged skeletal muscle fibers there is compromised integrity of the cell membrane that may contribute to sarcopenia. The purpose of this study was to determine if lifelong mild (8%) caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong CR + voluntary wheel running (WR) could ameliorate disruption of membrane scaffolding and signaling proteins during the aging process, thus maintaining a favorable, healthy membrane environment in plantaris muscle fibers. Fischer-344 rats were divided into four groups: 24-month old adults fed ad libitum (OAL); 24-month old on 8% caloric restriction (OCR); 24 month old 8% caloric restriction + wheel running (OCRWR); 6-month old sedentary adults fed ad libitum (YAL) were used to determine age-related changes. Aging resulted in discontinuous membrane expression of dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) proteins: dystrophin and α-syntrophin. Older muscle also displayed decreased content of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a key DGC signaling protein. In contrast, OCR and OCRWR provided significant protection against age-related DGC disruption. In conjunction with the age-related decline in membrane DGC patency, key membrane repair proteins (MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, and annexin A2) were significantly increased in the OAL plantaris. However, lifelong CR and CRWR interventions were effective at maintaining membrane repair proteins near YAL levels of. OAL fibers also displayed reduced protein content of NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (Nox2) subunits (p67phox and p47phox), consistent with a perturbed sarcolemmal environment. Loss of Nox2 subunits was prevented by lifelong CR and CRWR. Our results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that lifelong CR and WR are effective countermeasures against age-related alterations in the myofiber membrane environment.

"The impact of SRT2104 on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, redox biology, and loss of muscle mass in hindlimb unloaded rats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10342025/,"Mechanical unloading during microgravity causes skeletal muscle atrophy and impairs mitochondrial energetics. The elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mitochondria and Nox2, coupled with impairment of stress protection (e.g., SIRT1, antioxidant enzymes), contribute to atrophy. We tested the hypothesis that the SIRT1 activator, SRT2104 would rescue unloading-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial function in rat gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were evaluated under three conditions (10 days): ambulatory control (CON), hindlimb unloaded (HU), and hindlimb-unloaded-treated with SRT2104 (SIRT). Oxidative phosphorylation, electron transfer capacities, H 2 O 2 production, and oxidative and antioxidant enzymes were quantified using high-resolution respirometry and colorimetry. In the gastrocnemius, (1) integrative (per mg tissue) proton LEAK was lesser in SIRT than in HU or CON; (2) intrinsic (relative to citrate synthase) maximal noncoupled electron transfer capacity (E CI+II ) was lesser, while complex I-supported oxidative phosphorylation to E CI+II was greater in HU than CON; (3) the contribution of LEAK to E CI+II was greatest, but cytochrome c oxidase activity was lowest in HU. In both muscles, H 2 O 2 production and concentration was greatest in SIRT, as was gastrocnemius superoxide dismutase activity. In the soleus, H 2 O 2 concentration was greater in HU compared to CON. These results indicate that SRT2104 preserves mitochondrial function in unloaded skeletal muscle, suggesting its potential to support healthy muscle cells in microgravity by promoting necessary energy production in mitochondria.

Bioreactor development for skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy by manipulating uniaxial cyclic strain: Proof of concept.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11167039/,"Skeletal muscles overcome terrestrial, gravitational loading by producing tensile forces that produce movement through joint rotation. Conversely, the microgravity of spaceflight reduces tensile loads in working skeletal muscles, causing an adaptive muscle atrophy. Unfortunately, the design of stable, physiological bioreactors to model skeletal muscle tensile loading during spaceflight experiments remains challenging. Here, we tested a bioreactor that uses initiation and cessation of cyclic, tensile strain to induce hypertrophy and atrophy, respectively, in murine lineage (C2C12) skeletal muscle myotubes. Uniaxial cyclic stretch of myotubes was conducted using a StrexCell® (STB-1400) stepper motor system (0.75 Hz, 12% strain, 60 min day^-1). Myotube groups were assigned as follows: (a) quiescent over 2- or (b) 5-day (no stretch), (c) experienced 2-days (2dHY) or (d) 5-days (5dHY) of cyclic stretch, or (e) 2-days of cyclic stretch followed by a 3-day cessation of stretch (3dAT). Using ß-sarcoglycan as a sarcolemmal marker, mean myotube diameter increased significantly following 2dAT (51%) and 5dAT (94%) vs. matched controls. The hypertrophic, anabolic markers talin and Akt phosphorylation (Thr308) were elevated with 2dHY but not in 3dAT myotubes. Inflammatory, catabolic markers IL-1ß, IL6, and NF-kappaB p65 subunit were significantly higher in the 3dAT group vs. all other groups. The ratio of phosphorylated FoxO3a/total FoxO3a was significantly lower in 3dAT than in the 2dHY group, consistent with elevated catabolic signaling during unloading. In summary, we demonstrated proof-of-concept for a spaceflight research bioreactor, using uniaxial cyclic stretch to produce myotube hypertrophy with increased tensile loading, and myotube atrophy with subsequent cessation of stretch.

Genomic and phenotypic characterization of Burkholderia isolates from the potable water system of the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10020673/,"Urine, humidity condensate, and other sources of non-potable water are processed onboard the International Space Station (ISS) by the Water Recovery System (WRS) yielding potable water. While some means of microbial control are in place, including a phosphoric acid/hexavalent chromium urine pretreatment solution, many areas within the WRS are not available for routine microbial monitoring. Due to refurbishment needs, two flex lines from the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) within the WRS were removed and returned to Earth. The water from within these lines, as well as flush water, was microbially evaluated. Culture and culture-independent analysis revealed the presence of Burkholderia , Paraburkholderia , and Leifsonia . Fungal culture also identified Fusarium and Lecythophora . Hybrid de novo genome analysis of the five distinct Burkholderia isolates identified them as B. contaminans, while the two Paraburkholderia isolates were identified as P. fungorum . Chromate-resistance gene clusters were identified through pangenomic analysis that differentiated these genomes from previously studied isolates recovered from the point-of-use potable water dispenser and/or current NCBI references, indicating that unique populations exist within distinct niches in the WRS. Beyond genomic analysis, fixed samples directly from the lines were imaged by environmental scanning electron microscopy, which detailed networks of fungal-bacterial biofilms. This is the first evidence of biofilm formation within flex lines from the UPA onboard the ISS. For all bacteria isolated, biofilm potential was further characterized, with the B. contaminans isolates demonstrating the most considerable biofilm formation. Moreover, the genomes of the B. contaminans revealed secondary metabolite gene clusters associated with quorum sensing, biofilm formation, antifungal compounds, and hemolysins. The potential production of these gene cluster metabolites was phenotypically evaluated through biofilm, bacterial-fungal interaction, and hemolytic assays. Collectively, these data identify the UPA flex lines as a unique ecological niche and novel area of biofilm growth within the WRS. Further investigation of these organisms and their resistance profiles will enable engineering controls directed toward biofilm prevention in future space station water systems.

CAMDLES: CFD-DEM Simulation of Microbial Communities in Spaceflight and Artificial Microgravity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9144607/,"We present CAMDLES (CFD-DEM Artificial Microgravity Developments for Living Ecosystem Simulation), an extension of CFDEM ® Coupling to model biological flows, growth, and mass transfer in artificial microgravity devices. For microbes that accompany humans into space, microgravity-induced alterations in the fluid environment are likely to be a major factor in the microbial experience of spaceflight. Computational modeling is needed to investigate how well ground-based microgravity simulation methods replicate that experience. CAMDLES incorporates agent-based modeling to study inter-species metabolite transport within microbial communities in rotating wall vessel bioreactors (RWVs). Preexisting CFD modeling of RWVs has not yet incorporated growth; CAMDLES employs the simultaneous modeling of biological, chemical, and mechanical processes in a micro-scale rotating reference frame environment. Simulation mass transfer calculations were correlated with Monod dynamic parameters to predict relative growth rates between artificial microgravity, spaceflight microgravity, and 1 g conditions. By simulating a microbial model community of metabolically cooperative strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, we found that the greatest difference between microgravity and an RWV or 1 g gravity was when species colocalized in dense aggregates. We also investigated the influence of other features of the system on growth, such as spatial distribution, product yields, and diffusivity. Our simulation provides a basis for future laboratory experiments using this community for investigation in artificial microgravity and spaceflight microgravity. More broadly, our development of these models creates a framework for novel hypothesis generation and design of biological experiments with RWVs, coupling the effects of RWV size, rotation rate, and mass transport directly to bacterial growth in microbial communities.

Hardware validation of the Advanced Plant Habitat on ISS: Canopy photosynthesis in reduced gravity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314936/,"The Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) is the largest research plant growth facility deployed on the International Space Station (ISS). APH is a fully enclosed, closed-loop plant life support system with an environmentally controlled growth chamber designed for conducting both fundamental and applied plant research during experiments extending as long as 135 days. APH was delivered to the ISS in parts aboard two commercial resupply missions: OA-7 in April 2017 and SpaceX-11 in June 2017, and was assembled and installed in the Japanese Experiment Module Kibo in November 2018. We report here on a 7-week-long hardware validation test that utilized a root module planted with both Arabidopsis (cv. Col 0) and wheat (cv. Apogee) plants. The validation test examined the APH’s ability to control light intensity, spectral quality, humidity, CO 2 concentration, photoperiod, temperature, and root zone moisture using commanding from ground facilities at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The test also demonstrated the execution of programmed experiment profiles that scheduled: (1) changes in environmental combinations (e.g., a daily photoperiod at constant relative humidity), (2) predetermined photographic events using the three APH cameras [overhead, sideview, and sideview near-infrared (NIR)], and (3) execution of experimental sequences during the life cycle of a crop (e.g., measure photosynthetic CO 2 drawdown experiments). Arabidopsis and wheat were grown in microgravity to demonstrate crew procedures, planting protocols and watering schemes within APH. The ability of APH to contain plant debris was assessed during the harvest of mature Arabidopsis plants. Wheat provided a large evaporative load that tested root zone moisture control and the recovery of transpired water by condensation. The wheat canopy was also used to validate the ability of APH to measure gas exchange of plants from non-invasive gas exchange measurements (i.e., canopy photosynthesis and respiration). These features were evaluated by executing experiment profiles that utilized the CO 2 drawdown technique to measure daily rates of canopy photosynthesis and dark-period CO 2 increase for respiration. This hardware validation test confirmed that APH can measure fundamental plant responses to spaceflight conditions.

Trimeric structure of (+)-pinoresinol-forming dirigent protein at 1.95 A resolution with three isolated active sites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4340379/,"Control over phenoxy radical-radical coupling reactions in vivo in vascular plants was enigmatic until our discovery of dirigent proteins (DPs, from the Latin dirigere , to guide or align). The first three-dimensional structure of a DP ((+)-pinoresinol-forming DP, 1.95 Å resolution, rhombohedral space group H32)) is reported herein. It has a tightly packed trimeric structure with an eight-stranded β-barrel topology for each DP monomer. Each putative substrate binding and orientation coupling site is located on the trimer surface but too far apart for intermolecular coupling between sites. It is proposed that each site enables stereoselective coupling (using either two coniferyl alcohol radicals or a radical and a monolignol). Interestingly, there are six differentially conserved residues in DPs affording either the (+)- or (−)-antipodes in the vicinity of the putative binding site and region known to control stereoselectivity. DPs are involved in lignan biosynthesis, whereas dirigent domains/sites have been implicated in lignin deposition.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-jbc.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1984/4340379/df25db16e8d0/zbc0051505840001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1984/4340379/f95ef667461c/zbc0051505840002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1984/4340379/ac17581abc28/zbc0051505840003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1984/4340379/5aea5744c0e9/zbc0051505840004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1984/4340379/cbe829009db6/zbc0051505840005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1984/4340379/f1badcb451dc/zbc0051505840006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1984/4340379/0dd9b4b10542/zbc0051505840007.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1984/4340379/00152b1ab70c/zbc0051505840008.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1984/4340379/a674d362a16b/zbc0051505840009.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1984/4340379/ba16574d648b/zbc0051505840010.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Reduced Arogenate Dehydratase Expression: Ramifications for Photosynthesis and Metabolism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5933128/,"Arogenate dehydratase (ADT) catalyzes the final step of phenylalanine (Phe) biosynthesis. Previous work showed that ADT-deficient Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) mutants had significantly reduced lignin contents, with stronger reductions in lines that had deficiencies in more ADT isoforms. Here, by analyzing Arabidopsis ADT mutants using our phenomics facility and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we describe the effects of the modulation of ADT on photosynthetic parameters and secondary metabolism. Our data indicate that a reduced carbon flux into Phe biosynthesis in ADT mutants impairs the consumption of photosynthetically produced ATP, leading to an increased ATP/ADP ratio, the overaccumulation of transitory starch, and lower electron transport rates. The effect on electron transport rates is caused by an increase in proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane that down-regulates photosystem II activity by the high-energy quenching mechanism. Furthermore, quantitation of secondary metabolites in ADT mutants revealed reduced flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, lignan, and glucosinolate contents, including glucosinolates that are not derived from aromatic amino acids, and significantly increased contents of putative galactolipids and apocarotenoids. Additionally, we used real-time atmospheric monitoring mass spectrometry to compare respiration and carbon fixation rates between the wild type and adt3/4/5/6 , our most extreme ADT knockout mutant, which revealed no significant difference in both night- and day-adapted plants. Overall, these data reveal the profound effects of altered ADT activity and Phe metabolism on secondary metabolites and photosynthesis with implications for plant improvement.
Arogenate dehydratases (ADTs) catalyze the dehydrative decarboxylation of arogenate to Phe ( Jung et al., 1986 ; Siehl and Conn, 1988 ; Cho et al., 2007 ) in the stroma of chloroplasts and plastids in vascular plants ( Rippert et al., 2009 ). In terms of carbon allocation from photosynthesis, only a very small fraction of this Phe resides in proteins. Phe downstream metabolism is instead targeted largely toward generating substrates/precursors of lignin biopolymers and an enormous array of compounds that are predominantly phenylpropanoid/phenylpropanoid acetate metabolites, such as flavonoids ( Supplemental Fig. S1 ; Corea et al., 2012 ).
Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) has a six-member ADT gene family. However, it is not well understood (1) to what extent specific ADT genes are differentially regulated as to carbon allocation into distinct downstream metabolic branches and/or (2) what effect differential gene expression might have on metabolism overall, including upstream effects on photosynthesis capacity and source/sink relationships.
As shown previously, knockout mutants of the Arabidopsis ADT gene family were associated with different degrees of reduction of lignin content ( Corea et al., 2012 ). These plant lines were grown under long-day conditions (16 h of light) from germination to maturation (8–10 weeks), which induced stem elongation (bolting) and lignification. From the eight knockout lines generated, single knockouts of ADT1 and ADT3 had no apparent impact on bolting stem lignin content, whereas the ADT4 knockout resulted in a slightly higher lignin stem content and the ADT5 knockout had decreased lignin stem content by ∼18%. The adt4/5 line displayed a further reduction in lignin content of ∼38%, as did the triple knockouts adt1/4/5 and adt3/4/5 , which displayed ∼50% reductions. The quadruple knockout adt3/4/5/6 possessed the greatest magnitude of lignin reduction of ∼70% and was unable to maintain bolting stem structural integrity. The double mutant adt4/5 and the triple mutants adt1/4/5 and adt3/4/5 also displayed some visual evidence of bolting stem structural weakening.
Due to this important role in cell wall lignin biosynthesis, ADT is a potentially attractive target for metabolic engineering of lignin contents in plants ( Corea et al., 2012 ). However, remodeling of plant metabolism by genetic tools has to take into account the fact that biochemical reactions in the cell are interconnected, meaning that the manipulation of one specific pathway can potentially have several systemic consequences. Understanding such interdependencies is essential for metabolic engineering approaches to, for example, improve traits of interests in crop plants and forestry species. To explore the consequences of ADT modulation, the effects on the reactions biochemically upstream of photosynthetic energy conversion and overall metabolism were examined in ADT mutants.
Here, we describe a high-throughput phenotyping system (phenomics; Puthiyaveetil et al., 2014 ; Tietz et al., 2015 ) that allowed us to monitor changes in photosynthetic performance and growth over almost the entire vegetative growth period of Arabidopsis wild-type and ADT knockout mutant plants. For photosynthesis, this high-throughput approach was based on non-invasive optical determination of key photosynthetic parameters derived from chlorophyll fluorescence measurements ( Kramer et al., 2004 ; Baker, 2008 ; Brooks and Niyogi, 2011 ). Metabolomics analyses performed following photosynthetic parameter assessments (i.e. plants analyzed 44 days after sowing [DAS]), as well as later (70 DAS), focused on both targeted and non-targeted (polar) secondary metabolites using hyphenated liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry approaches. Real-time atmospheric monitoring-mass spectrometry (RTAM-MS) also was employed to evaluate net CO 2 uptake rates.

New insights into lignification via network and multi-omics analyses of arogenate dehydratase knock-out mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8185232/,"Multiple Arabidopsis arogenate dehydratase ( ADT ) knock-out (KO) mutants, with phenotypes having variable lignin levels (up to circa 70% reduction), were studied to investigate how differential reductions in ADTs perturb its overall plant systems biology. Integrated “omics” analyses (metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome) of wild type (WT), single and multiple ADT KO lines were conducted. Transcriptome and proteome data were collapsed into gene ortholog (GO) data, with this allowing for enzymatic reaction and metabolome cross-comparisons to uncover dominant or likely metabolic biosynthesis reactions affected. Network analysis of enzymes–highly correlated to stem lignin levels–deduced the involvement of novel putative lignin related proteins or processes. These included those associated with ribosomes, the spliceosome, mRNA transport, aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis, and phosphorylation. While prior work helped explain lignin biosynthesis regulation at the transcriptional level, our data here provide support for a new hypothesis that there are additional post-transcriptional and translational level processes that need to be considered. These findings are anticipated to lead to development of more accurate depictions of lignin/phenylpropanoid biosynthesis models in situ , with new protein targets identified for further biochemical analysis and/or plant bioengineering. Additionally, using KEGG defined functional categorization of proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, we detected significant changes to glucosinolate, α-linolenic acid, nitrogen, carotenoid, aromatic amino acid, phenylpropanoid, and photosynthesis-related metabolic pathways in ADT KO mutants. Metabolomics results also revealed that putative carotenoid and galactolipid levels were generally increased in amount, whereas many glucosinolates and phenylpropanoids (including flavonoids and lignans) were decreased in the KO mutants.

Functional consequences of radiation-induced oxidative stress in cultured neural stem cells and the brain exposed to charged particle irradiation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3936501/,"Aims: Redox homeostasis is critical in regulating the fate and function of multipotent cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we investigated whether low dose charged particle irradiation could elicit oxidative stress in neural stem and precursor cells and whether radiation-induced changes in redox metabolism would coincide with cognitive impairment. Results: Low doses (<1 Gy) of charged particles caused an acute and persistent oxidative stress. Early after (<1 week) irradiation, increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species were generally dose responsive, but were less dependent on dose weeks to months thereafter. Exposure to ion fluences resulting in less than one ion traversal per cell was sufficient to elicit radiation-induced oxidative stress. Whole body irradiation triggered a compensatory response in the rodent brain that led to a significant increase in antioxidant capacity 2 weeks following exposure, before returning to background levels at week 4. Low dose irradiation was also found to significantly impair novel object recognition in mice 2 and 12 weeks following irradiation. Innovation: Data provide evidence that acute exposure of neural stem cells and the CNS to very low doses and fluences of charged particles can elicit a persisting oxidative stress lasting weeks to months that is associated with impaired cognition. Conclusions: Exposure to low doses of charged particles causes a persistent oxidative stress and cognitive impairment over protracted times. Data suggest that astronauts subjected to space radiation may develop a heightened risk for mission critical performance decrements in space, along with a risk of developing long-term neurocognitive sequelae.

Exploration of space to achieve scientific breakthroughs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11998595/,"Beta cell replacement therapy for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is undergoing a transformative shift, driven by advances in stem cell biology, gene editing, and tissue engineering. While islet transplantation has demonstrated proof-of-concept success in restoring endogenous insulin production, its clinical impact remains limited by donor scarcity, immune rejection, and procedural complexities. The emergence of stem cell-derived beta-like cells represents a paradigm shift, with initial clinical trials showing promising insulin secretion in vivo . However, translating these breakthroughs into scalable, widely accessible treatments poses significant challenges. Drawing parallels to space exploration, this paper argues that while scientific feasibility has been demonstrated, true accessibility remains elusive. Without a strategic shift, beta cell therapy risks becoming an elite intervention, restricted by cost and infrastructure. Lessons from gene and cell therapies for rare diseases highlight the dangers of unsustainable pricing and limited market viability. To bridge the “last mile” a Quality by Design approach is proposed, emphasizing scalability, ease of use, and economic feasibility from the outset. By emphasizing practical implementation over academic achievements, corporate interests, market economics, or patent constraints, beta cell therapy can progress from proof-of-concept to a viable, widely accessible treatment.

At the 48th Annual Conference ISPAD, held on 13–16 October 2022, in Abu Dhabi, UAE, I was invited to deliver a lecture titled The Last Mile for Type 1 Diabetes cure [ 1 ]. The intention behind this title was to highlight the ambivalence of the concept: while many interpreted it optimistically as signaling the imminent arrival of a definitive cure, the phrase also carries a cautionary meaning. In many fields, the “last mile” is often the most complex and challenging stage of development, requiring careful navigation to ensure successful implementation [ 2 ]. History teaches us that assuming victory just before the finish line is a surefire way to trip over our own shoelaces.
The field of beta cell replacement therapy for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is currently undergoing a remarkable transformation [ 3 ]. Over the past two decades, the well-established islet transplantation paradigm has provided compelling proof-of-concept evidence that restoring endogenous insulin production can lead to long-term glycemic control, protection from severe hypoglycemia, and improved quality of life [ 4 – 11 ]. However, the approach remains fundamentally constrained by the limited availability of organ donors, the need for lifelong immunosuppression, and the challenges associated with islet engraftment and survival [ 11 – 13 ]. In other words, we have a therapy that works beautifully—just for not enough people to make a real difference.
Recent breakthroughs in stem cell biology, tissue engineering, and gene editing are now reshaping the landscape, with the potential to overcome these intrinsic limitations [ 14 – 17 ]. The successful differentiation of stem cell-derived beta-like cells—whether from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)—into insulin-producing cells suitable for transplantation represents a paradigm shift [ 18 – 23 ]. Initial clinical trials have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, with promising preliminary data showing functional insulin secretion in vivo [ 24 – 30 ]. The possibility of encapsulating or genetically engineering these cells to evade immune rejection could eventually obviate the need for chronic immunosuppression, further expanding the therapeutic potential [ 3 , 4 ]. This progress is the culmination of decades of interdisciplinary research, bringing us to an exciting and optimistic phase in the field. But before we start popping champagne, let’s remember that many promising scientific advances have met their demise at the hands of real-world implementation challenges. As we celebrate these successes, it’s important to recognize the complexity of what lies ahead. While the idea of the “last mile” in beta-cell replacement may suggest we are nearing a definitive solution, history shows that the final phase often brings its most rewarding challenges, offering opportunities for further breakthroughs and innovation.
To illustrate this, we can draw an analogy to space exploration. Sending the first humans to the moon was one of the most significant technological feats in modern history, showcasing the scientific ingenuity of our species. Can we say that humanity has mastered lunar travel? Certainly. Have we transitioned from exploration to colonization? Not even close. The Apollo program, which successfully landed twelve men on the moon over 12 years, cost an estimated $288 billion in today’s currency and required the effort of 400,000 people. Was it worth it? Undoubtedly. The benefits of space exploration extended far beyond the moon landings themselves, driving innovations in computing, materials science, and medicine. But if our goal had been to establish a thriving lunar metropolis, we would have been woefully unprepared. The engineering required to sustain a permanent presence on the moon is vastly different from what was needed for brief exploration missions.
Similarly, while we have demonstrated that stem cell-derived beta cells can function in human recipients, scaling this intervention to treat millions of individuals with T1D presents a new set of challenges [ 31 – 34 ]. We’ve planted the flag, but we’re nowhere near ready to move in. For now, we must acknowledge that only a select few will have access to this groundbreaking therapy in its early stages. Let’s be realistic: sending twelve men to the moon was a tremendous achievement, but building the infrastructure to support thousands is an entirely different level of challenge—and a much greater one when scaling up to millions. If we continue to approach beta cell replacement with an “Apollo mission” mindset, we risk creating a therapy that could be limited in accessibility. This would necessitate either stringent stratification based on risk-benefit analysis or, in a more troubling scenario, allocation based on financial capacity [ 35 , 36 ].
It’s important to note that the biomedical field, while it shares some characteristics with space exploration in terms of complexity, is inherently different. The decentralized, iterative nature of biomedical research allows for faster and more varied innovation, often driven by global collaboration, and offers a more dynamic landscape than the singular focus of space exploration. In this regard, the biomedical field has some distinct advantages, such as flexibility and the potential for rapid progress due to the contributions of many smaller, specialized teams rather than relying on a monolithic, top-down approach. But there are also disadvantages to this fragmented approach. Without a central focus, there is a risk of research becoming too diffuse, lacking the critical mass of knowledge and resources needed to make real breakthroughs in a timely manner. The dispersed nature of the research may lead to silos of knowledge, and sometimes, these separate efforts can lack the cohesion necessary to propel the field forward efficiently. In the case of beta-cell replacement therapy, for instance, without a unified, coordinated strategy, progress may be delayed, and key challenges, such as creating scalable and affordable solutions, could remain unresolved.
Perhaps we do not fully consider the complexities of the “last mile” in scientific progress, where the challenges of scaling and ensuring widespread accessibility can be more intricate and demanding than the initial breakthroughs themselves. A recent reflection on human genome editing serves as a case in point [ 37 ]. It has been suggested that polygenic genome editing could become feasible within the next three decades, with theoretical models indicating that it could significantly reduce susceptibility to diseases such as coronary artery disease, Alzheimer’s, depression, diabetes, and schizophrenia. This is an intriguing prospect with profound ethical implications, but one thing is already clear and underestimated: this approach is unlikely to be applied to a significant portion of the population within any realistic timeframe. Why? Because it would require in vitro fertilization for every individual undergoing genome editing [ 38 ]. Once again, we have explored the possibility, but we have not “colonized” it. For a more immediate comparison to beta cell therapy, let’s assume for a moment that, starting today, we could transplant pancreatic islets without requiring immunosuppression. Would that mean we have reached the last mile in curing type 1 diabetes? Not at all. The number of donors would remain severely limited, and the procedure, still highly dependent on skilled operators, could not be automated or broadly implemented. Therefore, only a small group would have access, and this does not even take into account the cost factor.
Indeed, when considering the “last mile” in cell-based therapies, one of the major challenges is the cost, which may prevent the therapy from being automated or widely implemented. The case of gene and cell therapies for rare diseases serves as a cautionary tale [ 39 ]. Several promising therapies have been approved but later withdrawn from the market due to unsustainable pricing models and difficulties in reimbursement [ 40 , 41 ]. Notable examples include Glybera, the first gene therapy approved in Europe, which was withdrawn in 2017, after being deemed commercially unviable, and Strimvelis, a gene therapy for ADA-SCID, which faced similar market challenges. News has recently emerged about the suspension of the development and commercialization of the hemophilia B gene therapy fidanacogene elaparvovec (marketed as Beqvez in the United States and Durveqtix in Europe) by Pfizer [ 42 ]. Fidanacogene elaparvovec marks the ninth advanced therapy to be withdrawn from the European market since 2015, a significant figure considering that only 27 such therapies have reached commercialization in total [ 43 ]. Notably, no patients appear to have received the therapy after its approval in the United States. Its price tag—$3.5 million per patient—certainly does not lend itself to widespread adoption. Another shake-up in the sector came with the recent developments surrounding bluebird bio, Inc. Founded with the mission of developing gene therapies for rare diseases, the company had already sparked debate over the sustainability of advanced therapies back in 2021, following the simultaneous withdrawal of two gene therapies from the European market—one for beta-thalassemia and the other for cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (the latter of which remained available for only 3 months). Once valued at $11 billion in 2018, bluebird bio faced mounting financial difficulties due to high development costs and limited market access. Recently, the company was acquired by U.S. funds for a mere $30 million—a staggering devaluation that underscores the economic challenges plaguing biotech firms specializing in advanced therapies. 1 The model used for rare disease therapies may not be directly applicable to widespread conditions like T1D, especially when scaling therapies like beta-cell replacement. In rare diseases, high per-patient costs are manageable, but for large populations, cost-reduction strategies are essential. A key approach is leveraging economies of scale, particularly in allogeneic therapies, where a single batch can treat multiple patients, spreading fixed costs and reducing per-patient expenses. However, autologous therapies face limitations in this regard due to the need for individualized production, which results in higher costs. Advancements in automation and bioprocessing technologies could reduce costs for both autologous and allogeneic therapies, but there are risks. Despite technological innovations, therapies may remain financially unfeasible for large populations due to high raw material costs, specialized facilities, and regulatory hurdles. Additionally, cost-reduction efforts must not compromise the therapy’s quality or efficacy, as this could undermine its long-term success.
So, the real question is: how we can successfully and safely navigate the “last mile”? One option is to place unwavering faith in scientific progress, if what seems impossible today will inevitably become reality. After all, history is filled with once-fantastical ideas that have materialized into everyday technology. In Star Trek (1964), the crew communicated using sleek, flip-open devices—perfect for intergalactic adventures. Three decades later, Motorola’s StarTAC brought that vision to life. Waiting, as Samuel Beckett illustrated in Waiting for Godot , carries profound human dignity. But waiting can also turn into a tragicomedy if it assumes that progress has no intrinsic limits—that it is merely a matter of time.
A second option is to take a different approach, drawing inspiration from the Quality by Design (QbD) framework [ 44 – 46 ]. For those unfamiliar with it, QbD is, above all, a philosophy that shifts the focus from quality control to quality by intentional design. It emphasizes that quality should not be tested into a product but rather built into it from the very beginning. At the core of QbD is the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP), which defines the desired characteristics of a product, guiding its entire development. Fundamentally, the QbD approach marks a shift from a reactive, retrospective evaluation to a proactive, predictive model. Traditional quality control methods often rely on detecting and correcting issues after production. In contrast, QbD anticipates critical points and constraints during the design phase, allowing for a better understanding of the boundaries within which the process must operate. This shift from “test-and-fix” to “design-and-predict” enables more robust, efficient, and scalable therapeutic solutions, particularly in emerging fields like cell therapy. This concept is particularly crucial in the field of cell therapy, where the QTPP is not just about the intrinsic properties of the cellular product itself. Unlike conventional pharmaceuticals, cell therapies are living drugs, meaning their effectiveness and behavior depend on the dynamic interaction with the patient receiving the treatment. This reciprocal relationship between the therapy and the individual means that the QTPP must account for factors such as patient-specific responses, variability in the cellular product, and the evolving nature of the treatment within the body.
It is not my intention here to delve into the numerous complex aspects associated with the QbD approach in the field of beta-cell transplantation, aspects that are far from irrelevant. For example, defining Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) for stem cell-derived beta cells (such as insulin secretion kinetics and purity) requires standardized assays, which remain underdeveloped. Even the discussion regarding the quality and potency of human pancreatic islets remains extensive [ 47 ]. To provide a sense of this complexity, in the recent FDA discussions concerning the approval of the Biologics License Application for pancreatic islets, 2 potency criteria were suggested based on parameters such as ≥70% viable islets, counting based on DTZ staining and microscopic evaluation, as well as the ratio of insulin secretion under high glucose stimulation to low glucose stimulation (≥1). Ironically, some probiotic strains, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae , could potentially exhibit similar metrics under certain conditions [ 48 ], highlighting the complexity and challenges in defining appropriate potency criteria for beta cel replacement. Moreover, regulatory alignment with agencies like the FDA/EMA is also understated and warrants more attention. Regulatory agencies play a critical role in the successful development, approval, and commercialization of novel therapies. However, in the case of beta-cell replacement therapies, particularly those derived from stem cells, there is a need for more comprehensive alignment with regulatory standards and guidelines.
Instead, in this context, I propose the broader adoption of the QTPP concept. Rather than focusing solely on traditional product quality parameters, QTPP advocates for a more comprehensive, patient-centered approach—an approach especially vital in the realm of stem cell-based therapies like beta-cell transplantation. The challenge goes beyond simply creating a functional cellular product; it is also about ensuring its scalability, as a transformative therapy that remains accessible to only a few is little more than an academic achievement. Therefore, rather than concentrating exclusively on the intrinsic qualities of the cellular product, a key step should be the definition of the QTPP—not only in terms of what the therapy is, but also how it will be administered, how it will interact with the patient, and the broader context in which it will be applied ( Figure 1 ). If this is the lens through which we view the problem, then as a physician-scientist, I must wonder: what kind of product would I actually want to use? Ideally, it would be cryopreserved and easily thawed at the bedside with warm water, compatible with a standard syringe, and administered much like a simple intramuscular injection—no operating room, no GMP facility for post-thaw reconstitution, no angiographic suite for infusion, etc… A final product of just a few milliliters, nothing more. From this endpoint, we must work backward, establishing constraints from the outset. The goal is not to design a product that functions beautifully under ideal conditions but one that remains viable when deployed at scale. The constraints should not reflect what is manageable for an expert in a specialized lab or clinic but what is operationally feasible for millions of patients worldwide. Returning to the Apollo 13 analogy, the lesson lies in NASA’s approach to solving the air filter crisis [ 49 ]. They could have designed the ideal filtration system from scratch—but instead, they worked within the limits of what was already onboard, using available materials to construct a viable solution. In today’s terms, this was an exercise in design thinking , and it is precisely the mindset we need before moving forward. Recognizing this early is critical. It informs the definition of QTPPs and CQAs , which, in turn, shape every aspect of development—including procedural simplicity, implant size, and invasiveness. Consider this: if we could eliminate the need for an angiographic suite, a surgical team, or anything beyond local anesthesia, would not that already be a breakthrough? Similarly, as a healthcare provider, I must consider: how much can I afford to spend on beta-cell therapy for an individual with T1D? Defining this is essential, as sustainability is a key element of scalability, and in my view, it should be incorporated into the QTPP definition. In this regard, there should be a stronger focus on academic research into the economics of Beta-Cell Replacement Therapy. Furthermore, it is crucial to recognize that the economic sustainability of therapies is not only about cost-effectiveness but also about broader financial considerations. This was demonstrated in the past with hepatitis C treatments in countries with advanced public welfare systems [ 50 ].","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-transinter.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7a81/11998595/92fea25f8316/ti-38-14565-g001.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Network Analysis of Gene Transcriptions of Arabidopsis thaliana in Spaceflight Microgravity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7996555/,"The transcriptomic datasets of the plant model organism Arabidopsis thaliana grown in the International Space Station provided by GeneLab have been mined to isolate the impact of spaceflight microgravity on gene expressions related to root growth. A set of computational tools is used to identify the hub genes that respond differently in spaceflight with controlled lighting compared to on the ground. These computational tools based on graph-theoretic approaches are used to infer gene regulatory networks from the transcriptomic datasets. The three main algorithms used for network analyses are Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Pearson correlation, and the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm. Graph-based spectral analyses reveal distinct properties of the spaceflight microgravity networks for the Wassilewskija (WS), Columbia (Col)-0, and mutant phytochromeD ( phyD ) ecotypes. The set of hub genes that are significantly altered in spaceflight microgravity are mainly involved in cell wall synthesis, protein transport, response to auxin, stress responses, and catabolic processes. Network analysis highlights five important root growth-regulating hub genes that have the highest outdegree distribution in spaceflight microgravity networks. These concerned genes coding for proteins are identified from the Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) corresponding to spaceflight total light environment. Furthermore, network analysis uncovers genes that encode nucleotide-diphospho-sugar interconversion enzymes that have higher transcriptional regulation in spaceflight microgravity and are involved in cell wall biosynthesis.

Detection of Genes in Arabidopsis thaliana L. Responding to DNA Damage from Radiation and Other Stressors in Spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8234954/,"Ionizing radiation present in extraterrestrial environment is an important factor that affects plants grown in spaceflight. Pearson correlation-based gene regulatory network inferencing from transcriptional responses of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana L. grown in real and simulated spaceflight conditions acquired by GeneLab, followed by topological and spectral analysis of the networks is performed. Gene regulatory subnetworks are extracted for DNA damage response processes. Analysis of radiation-induced ATR/ATM protein–protein interactions in Arabidopsis reveals interaction profile similarities under low radiation doses suggesting novel mechanisms of DNA damage response involving non-radiation-induced genes regulating other stress responses in spaceflight. The Jaccard similarity index shows that the genes AT2G31320, AT4G21070, AT2G46610, and AT3G27060 perform similar functions under low doses of radiation. The incremental association Markov blanket method reveals non-radiation-induced genes linking DNA damage response to root growth and plant development. Eighteen radiation-induced genes and sixteen non-radiation-induced gene players have been identified from the ATR/ATM protein interaction complexes involved in heat, salt, water, osmotic stress responses, and plant organogenesis. Network analysis and logistic regression ranking detected AT3G27060, AT1G07500, AT5G66140, and AT3G21280 as key gene players involved in DNA repair processes. High atomic weight, high energy, and gamma photon radiation result in higher intensity of DNA damage response in the plant resulting in elevated values for several network measures such as spectral gap and girth. Nineteen flavonoid and carotenoid pigment activations involved in pigment biosynthesis processes are identified in low radiation dose total light spaceflight environment but are not found to have significant regulations under very high radiation dose environment.

"The Effect of spaceflight on mouse olfactory bulb volume, neurogenesis, and cell death indicates the protective effect of novel environment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4152162/,"Space missions necessitate physiological and psychological adaptations to environmental factors not present on Earth, some of which present significant risks for the central nervous system (CNS) of crewmembers. One CNS region of interest is the adult olfactory bulb (OB), as OB structure and function are sensitive to environmental- and experience-induced regulation. It is currently unknown how the OB is altered by spaceflight. In this study, we evaluated OB volume and neurogenesis in mice shortly after a 13-day flight on Space Shuttle Atlantis [Space Transport System (STS)-135] relative to two groups of control mice maintained on Earth. Mice housed on Earth in animal enclosure modules that mimicked the conditions onboard STS-135 (AEM-Ground mice) had greater OB volume relative to mice maintained in standard housing on Earth (Vivarium mice), particularly in the granule (GCL) and glomerular (GL) cell layers. AEM-Ground mice also had more OB neuroblasts and fewer apoptotic cells relative to Vivarium mice. However, the AEM-induced increase in OB volume and neurogenesis was not seen in STS-135 mice (AEM-Flight mice), suggesting that spaceflight may have negated the positive effects of the AEM. In fact, when OB volume of AEM-Flight mice was considered, there was a greater density of apoptotic cells relative to AEM-Ground mice. Our findings suggest that factors present during spaceflight have opposing effects on OB size and neurogenesis, and provide insight into potential strategies to preserve OB structure and function during future space missions.

in the past decade , space agencies have transitioned from completion of low Earth orbit missions in the International Space Station to proposal of long-term interplanetary missions to the Moon and Mars ( 18 , 109 ). The increased duration and distance of these future missions may compromise the health of crewmembers during spaceflight, as the crew will have to adapt to a combination of environmental factors unique to spaceflight. These factors include presumably negative factors such as ionizing particle radiation ( 78 ), microgravity ( 96 ), abnormal circadian rhythm triggers ( 8 , 54 ), and psychosocial stress ( 43 ), as well as potentially positive factors, such as the novel environment of the spacecraft and mission. While it is not completely understood how these combined and dynamic factors affect the health of crewmembers, evidence suggests that the central nervous system (CNS) undergoes adaptations to spaceflight that may impair mission success ( 17 , 19 , 65 , 84 , 96 ). More work is needed, however, to better understand how discrete regions of the CNS and their respective functions are modulated by the experience of spaceflight.
A useful brain region in which to explore the effects of spaceflight on the CNS is the olfactory bulb (OB). The structure and function of the OB are highly influenced by environmental and physiological stimuli ( 51 ), such that changes in OB size often positively correlate with changes in olfactory function. For example, in mammals, including humans, increased OB volume correlates with enhanced OB function and recovery following olfactory trauma ( 83 ). In contrast, decreased OB volume correlates with diminished olfactory input ( 37 ) and diminished olfactory ability ( 28 , 39 ). However, olfactory function can also be improved following odor deprivation ( 6 ), indicating the bidirectional nature of OB plasticity to environmental- and experience-induced regulation. OB plasticity is not only linked with changes in olfactory ability but also may provide early insight into the progression of psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases ( 35 , 38 , 104 ). For example, deficits in olfaction are frequently observed well before the appearance of severe neurological symptoms associated with late-stage Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases ( 35 ). Decreased OB size is also observed in a rat model of depression ( 107 ), emphasizing the clinical relevance of OB volume.
A major contributor to the plasticity of OB volume is neurogenesis, or the process of birth and death of OB neurons that continues throughout life. Functional OB interneurons, granule cells, and periglomerular cells are generated into adulthood ( 50 , 51 ), and their integration is correlated with the complexity of the olfactory environment ( 59 , 75 , 80 , 81 ). For example, sensory enrichment or passive exposure to new odorants increases OB neurogenesis ( 57 , 66 , 93 ) and sensory activity ( 55 , 59 ) and improves olfactory discrimination abilities ( 60 , 61 , 80 ). Improved olfactory discrimination, in turn, strengthens synaptic function in the olfactory cortex ( 27 ). In contrast, sensory deprivation by nostril occlusion reduces new OB granule cell number and OB function ( 58 , 85 ). Although OB neurogenesis continues throughout life, it is influenced by many factors, some of which are present during spaceflight. For example, high doses of acute and chronic ionizing radiation decrease OB volume and neurogenesis in rodents ( 22 , 36 , 46 ), which may jeopardize OB function ( 57 , 85 ). However, it is unknown how the entire spaceflight experience, including exposure to both negative and positive factors noted above, influences OB size and neurogenesis.
To address how the unique combination of environmental and physiological factors present during spaceflight influence OB structure, we evaluated OB volume and neurogenesis in adult mice shortly following a 13-day flight on Space Shuttle Atlantis [Space Transport System (STS)-135]. We hypothesized that due to the numerous negative factors present during spaceflight, mice aboard STS-135 would have decreased OB volume and neurogenesis compared with mice maintained on Earth. Interestingly, however, we found that mice maintained on Earth in animal enclosure modules (AEM) that mimicked the onboard flight conditions had greater OB volume and neurogenesis compared with mice maintained in standard housing conditions on Earth and mice housed in AEM cages onboard STS-135. These findings suggest that factors present during space travel have opposing effects on OB size and neurogenesis.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-jap.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7bf9/4152162/a8ca8477e7e1/zdg0111410560001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7bf9/4152162/f829a9c93f01/zdg0111410560002.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

Characterization of mouse ocular response to a 35-day spaceflight mission: Evidence of blood-retinal barrier disruption and ocular adaptations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6547757/,"The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg) (p < 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight.

Mice Exposed to Combined Chronic Low-Dose Irradiation and Modeled Microgravity Develop Long-Term Neurological Sequelae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6747492/,"Spaceflight poses many challenges for humans. Ground-based analogs typically focus on single parameters of spaceflight and their associated acute effects. This study assesses the long-term transcriptional effects following single and combination spaceflight analog conditions using the mouse model: simulated microgravity via hindlimb unloading (HLU) and/or low-dose γ-ray irradiation (LDR) for 21 days, followed by 4 months of readaptation. Changes in gene expression and epigenetic modifications in brain samples during readaptation were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). The results showed minimal gene expression and cytosine methylation alterations at 4 months readaptation within single treatment conditions of HLU or LDR. In contrast, following combined HLU+LDR, gene expression and promoter methylation analyses showed multiple altered pathways involved in neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, the regulation of neuropeptides, and cellular signaling. In brief, neurological readaptation following combined chronic LDR and HLU is a dynamic process that involves pathways that regulate neuronal function and structure and may lead to late onset neurological sequelae.

"Spaceflight influences gene expression, photoreceptor integrity, and oxidative stress-related damage in the murine retina.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6746706/,"Extended spaceflight has been shown to adversely affect astronaut visual acuity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten week old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Within 38 (+/−4) hours after splashdown, mice ocular tissues were collected for analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress. Total retinal, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid layer thickness were significantly lower after spaceflight. These results indicate that retinal performance may decrease over extended periods of spaceflight and cause visual impairment.

Evaluating ocular response in the retina and optic nerve head after single and fractionated high-energy protons,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8400407/,"There are serious concerns about possible late radiation damage to ocular tissue from prolonged space radiation exposure, and occupational and medical procedures. This study aimed to investigate the effects of whole-body high-energy proton exposure at a single dose on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and blood-retina barrier (BRB) integrity in the retina and optic nerve head (ONH) region and to compare these radiation-induced effects with those produced by fractionated dose. Six-month-old C57BL/6 male mice were either sham irradiated or received whole-body high energy proton irradiation at an acute single dose of 0.5 Gy or 12 equal dose fractions for a total dose of 0.5 Gy over twenty-five days. At four months following irradiation, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for histochemical analysis. Significant increases in the number of apoptotic cells were documented in the mouse retinas and ONHs that received proton radiation with a single or fractionated dose ( p < 0.05). Immunochemical analysis revealed enhanced immunoreactivity for oxidative biomarker, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the retina and ONH following single or fractionated protons with more pronounced changes observed with a single dose of 0.5 Gy. BRB integrity was also evaluated with biomarkers of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), a water channel protein, a tight junction (TJ) protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and an adhesion molecule, the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). A significantly increased expression of AQP-4 was observed in the retina following a single dose exposure compared to controls. There was also a significant increase in the expression of PECAM-1 and a decrease in the expression of ZO-1 in the retina. These changes give a strong indication of disturbance to BRB integrity in the retina. Interestingly, there was very limited immunoreactivity of AQP-4 and ZO-1 seen in the ONH region, pointing to possible lack of BRB properties as previously reported. Our data demonstrated that exposure to proton radiation of 0.5 Gy induced oxidative stress-associated apoptosis in the retina and ONH, and changes in BRB integrity in the retina. Our study also revealed the differences in BRB biomarker distribution between these two regions. In response to radiation insults, the cellular response in the retina and ONH may be differentially regulated in acute or hyperfractionated dose schedules.

Characterization of gene expression profiles in the mouse brain after 35 days of spaceflight mission.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9365836/,"It has been proposed that neuroinflammatory response plays an important role in the neurovascular remodeling in the brain after stress. The goal of the present study was to characterize changes in the gene expression profiles associated with neuroinflammation, neuronal function, metabolism and stress in mouse brain tissue. Ten-week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission. Within 38 ± 4 h of splashdown, mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues were collected for analysis. A novel digital color-coded barcode counting technology (NanoString TM ) was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. A set of 54 differently expressed genes ( p < 0.05) significantly segregates the habitat ground control (GC) group from flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly altered by flight conditions. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were significantly downregulated. Here we report that significantly altered immune reactions may be closely associated with spaceflight-induced stress responses and have an impact on the neuronal function.

A multi-omics longitudinal study of the murine retinal response to chronic low-dose irradiation and simulated microgravity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9547011/,"The space environment includes unique hazards like radiation and microgravity which can adversely affect biological systems. We assessed a multi-omics NASA GeneLab dataset where mice were hindlimb unloaded and/or gamma irradiated for 21 days followed by retinal analysis at 7 days, 1 month or 4 months post-exposure. We compared time-matched epigenomic and transcriptomic retinal profiles resulting in a total of 4178 differentially methylated loci or regions, and 457 differentially expressed genes. Highest correlation in methylation difference was seen across different conditions at the same time point. Nucleotide metabolism biological processes were enriched in all groups with activation at 1 month and suppression at 7 days and 4 months. Genes and processes related to Notch and Wnt signaling showed alterations 4 months post-exposure. A total of 23 genes showed significant changes in methylation and expression compared to unexposed controls, including genes involved in retinal function and inflammatory response. This multi-omics analysis interrogates the epigenomic and transcriptomic impacts of radiation and hindlimb unloading on the retina in isolation and in combination and highlights important molecular mechanisms at different post-exposure stages.

Evidence of spaceflight-induced adverse effects on photoreceptors and retinal function in the mouse eye.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10138634/,"The goal of the present study was to characterize acute oxidative damage in ocular structure and retinal function after exposure to spaceflight, and to evaluate the efficacy of an antioxidant in reducing spaceflight-induced changes in the retina. Ten-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS on Space-X 24 over 35 days, and returned to Earth alive. The mice received a weekly injection of a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), before launch and during their stay onboard the ISS. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Before the launch, intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using a handheld tonometer and retinal function was evaluated using electroretinogram (ERG). ERG signals were recorded when the mouse eye was under dark-adapted conditions in response to ultraviolet monochromatic light flashes. Within 20 h after splashdown, IOP and ERG assessments were repeated before euthanasia. There were significant increases in body weight for habitat control groups post-flight compared to pre-flight measurements. However, the body weights were similar among flight groups before launch and after splashdown. The IOP measurements were similar between pre- and post-flight groups with no significant differences between BuOE-treated and saline controls. Immunofluorescence evaluation showed increases in retinal oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death after spaceflight. BuOE treatment significantly decreased the level of the oxidative stress biomarker. ERG data showed that the average amplitudes of the a- and b-wave were significantly decreased (39% and 32% by spaceflight, respectively) compared to that of habitat ground controls. These data indicate that spaceflight conditions induce oxidative stress in the retina, which may lead to photoreceptor cell damage and retinal function impairment.

Effects of spaceflight on the brain,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12031868/,"Under conditions of weightlessness human position sense appears to deteriorate. This was tested, employing three methods of measurement: two-arm matching, one-arm pointing and one-arm repositioning, carried out during parabolic flight. In hypergravity (1.8G), position sense errors in a matching task increased significantly from the value during horizontal flight (1G) of + 2.5° (± 3.8° SD), to + 3.5° (± 3.3°). For pointing, errors increased significantly from + 9.1° (± 4.4°) to + 11.2° (± 4.4°). In microgravity (0G), matching errors fell significantly to + 0.35° (± 3.5°), while in pointing the fall was not significant. For repositioning, there were no significant changes in errors in either hypergravity or microgravity. It is proposed that the errors in matching and pointing are a consequence of the force of gravity acting at the elbow joint to alter the position signal coming from muscle and joint receptors. For repositioning, memory of the test angle was stored centrally, to be reproduced independently of any changes in gravity.

Genomic characterization and radiation tolerance of Naganishia kalamii sp. nov. and Cystobasidium onofrii sp. nov. from Mars 2020 mission assembly facilities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10422843/,"During the construction and assembly of the Mars 2020 mission components at two different NASA cleanrooms, several fungal strains were isolated. Based on their colony morphology, two strains that showed yeast-like appearance were further characterized for their phylogenetic position. The species-level classification of these two novel strains, using traditional colony and cell morphology methods combined with the phylogenetic reconstructions using multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on several gene loci (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB 1, RPB2 , CYTB and TEF1 ), and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out. This polyphasic taxonomic approach supported the conclusion that the two basidiomycetous yeasts belong to hitherto undescribed species. The strain FJI-L2-BK-P3 T , isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Spacecraft Assembly Facility, was placed in the Naganishia albida clade (Filobasidiales, Tremellomycetes), but is genetically and physiologically different from other members of the clade. Another yeast strain FKI-L6-BK-PAB1 T , isolated from the Kennedy Space Center Payload Hazardous and Servicing Facility, was placed in the genus Cystobasidium ( Cystobasidiales, Cystobasidiomycetes ) and is distantly related to C. benthicum. Here we propose two novel species with the type strains, Naganishia kalamii sp. nov. (FJI-L2-BK-P3 T = NRRL 64466 = DSM 115730) and Cystobasidium onofrii sp. nov. (FKI-L6-BK-PAB1 T = NRRL 64426 = DSM 114625). The phylogenetic analyses revealed that single gene phylogenies (ITS or LSU) were not conclusive, and MLSA and WGS-based phylogenies were more advantageous for species discrimination in the two genera. The genomic analysis predicted proteins associated with dehydration and desiccation stress-response and the presence of genes that are directly related to osmotolerance and psychrotolerance in both novel yeasts described. Cells of these two newly-described yeasts were exposed to UV-C radiation and compared with N. onofrii, an extremophilic UV-C resistant cold-adapted Alpine yeast. Both novel species were UV resistant, emphasizing the need for collecting and characterizing extremotolerant microbes, including yeasts, to improve microbial reduction techniques used in NASA planetary protection programs.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-imafungus.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7dde/10422843/3435fe473aa0/43008_2023_119_Fig1_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7dde/10422843/561c8b6b1769/43008_2023_119_Fig4_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7dde/10422843/c45ee8c0edcd/43008_2023_119_Fig2_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7dde/10422843/53502b49a6a7/43008_2023_119_Fig3_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7dde/10422843/d6101ff47625/43008_2023_119_Fig5_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7dde/10422843/472a7e29351d/43008_2023_119_Fig6_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7dde/10422843/773903c7cd9d/43008_2023_119_Fig7_HTML.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

Molecular and physiologic changes in the SpaceX Inspiration4 civilian crew,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11357997/,"Human spaceflight has historically been managed by government agencies, such as in the NASA Twins Study 1 , but new commercial spaceflight opportunities have opened spaceflight to a broader population. In 2021, the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission launched the first all-civilian crew to low Earth orbit, which included the youngest American astronaut (aged 29), new in-flight experimental technologies (handheld ultrasound imaging, smartwatch wearables and immune profiling), ocular alignment measurements and new protocols for in-depth, multi-omic molecular and cellular profiling. Here we report the primary findings from the 3-day spaceflight mission, which induced a broad range of physiological and stress responses, neurovestibular changes indexed by ocular misalignment, and altered neurocognitive functioning, some of which match those of long-term spaceflight 2 , but almost all of which did not differ from baseline (pre-flight) after return to Earth. Overall, these preliminary civilian spaceflight data suggest that short-duration missions do not pose a significant health risk, and moreover present a rich opportunity to measure the earliest phases of adaptation to spaceflight in the human body at anatomical, cellular, physiological and cognitive levels. Finally, these methods and results lay the foundation for an open, rapidly expanding biomedical database for astronauts 3 , which can inform countermeasure development for both private and government-sponsored space missions.

Telomeric RNA (TERRA) increases in response to spaceflight and high-altitude climbing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11167063/,"Telomeres are repetitive nucleoprotein complexes at chromosomal termini essential for maintaining genome stability. Telomeric RNA, or TERRA, is a previously presumed long noncoding RNA of heterogeneous lengths that contributes to end-capping structure and function, and facilitates telomeric recombination in tumors that maintain telomere length via the telomerase-independent Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway. Here, we investigated TERRA in the radiation-induced DNA damage response (DDR) across astronauts, high-altitude climbers, healthy donors, and cellular models. Similar to astronauts in the space radiation environment and climbers of Mt. Everest, in vitro radiation exposure prompted increased transcription of TERRA, while simulated microgravity did not. Data suggest a specific TERRA DDR to telomeric double-strand breaks (DSBs), and provide direct demonstration of hybridized TERRA at telomere-specific DSB sites, indicative of protective TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid formation. Targeted telomeric DSBs also resulted in accumulation of TERRA foci in G2-phase, supportive of TERRA’s role in facilitating recombination-mediated telomere elongation. Results have important implications for scenarios involving persistent telomeric DNA damage, such as those associated with chronic oxidative stress (e.g., aging, systemic inflammation, environmental and occupational radiation exposures), which can trigger transient ALT in normal human cells, as well as for targeting TERRA as a therapeutic strategy against ALT-positive tumors.

Spatial multi-omics of human skin reveals KRAS and inflammatory responses to spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166909/,"Spaceflight can change metabolic, immunological, and biological homeostasis and cause skin rashes and irritation, yet the molecular basis remains unclear. To investigate the impact of short-duration spaceflight on the skin, we conducted skin biopsies on the Inspiration4 crew members before (L-44) and after (R + 1) flight. Leveraging multi-omics assays including GeoMx™ Digital Spatial Profiler, single-cell RNA/ATAC-seq, and metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, we assessed spatial gene expressions and associated microbial and immune changes across 95 skin regions in four compartments: outer epidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis, and vasculature. Post-flight samples showed significant up-regulation of genes related to inflammation and KRAS signaling across all skin regions. These spaceflight-associated changes mapped to specific cellular responses, including altered interferon responses, DNA damage, epithelial barrier disruptions, T-cell migration, and hindered regeneration were located primarily in outer tissue compartments. We also linked epithelial disruption to microbial shifts in skin swab and immune cell activity to PBMC single-cell data from the same crew and timepoints. Our findings present the inaugural collection and examination of astronaut skin, offering insights for future space missions and response countermeasures.

Longitudinal multi-omics analysis of host microbiome architecture and immune responses during short-term spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11222149/,"Maintenance of astronaut health during spaceflight will require monitoring and potentially modulating their microbiomes. However, documenting microbial shifts during spaceflight has been difficult due to mission constraints that lead to limited sampling and profiling. Here we executed a six-month longitudinal study to quantify the high-resolution human microbiome response to three days in orbit for four individuals. Using paired metagenomics and metatranscriptomics alongside single-nuclei immune cell profiling, we characterized time-dependent, multikingdom microbiome changes across 750 samples and 10 body sites before, during and after spaceflight at eight timepoints. We found that most alterations were transient across body sites; for example, viruses increased in skin sites mostly during flight. However, longer-term shifts were observed in the oral microbiome, including increased plaque-associated bacteria (for example, Fusobacteriota ), which correlated with immune cell gene expression. Further, microbial genes associated with phage activity, toxin–antitoxin systems and stress response were enriched across multiple body sites.

Spatiotemporal expression and control of haemoglobin in space,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166948/,"It is now widely recognised that the environment in space activates a diverse set of genes involved in regulating fundamental cellular pathways. This includes the activation of genes associated with blood homeostasis and erythropoiesis, with a particular emphasis on those involved in globin chain production. Haemoglobin biology provides an intriguing model for studying space omics, as it has been extensively explored at multiple -omic levels, spanning DNA, RNA, and protein analyses, in both experimental and clinical contexts. In this study, we examined the developmental expression of haemoglobin over time and space using a unique suite of multi-omic datasets available on NASA GeneLab, from the NASA Twins Study, the JAXA CFE study, and the Inspiration4 mission. Our findings reveal significant variations in globin gene expression corresponding to the distinct spatiotemporal characteristics of the collected samples. This study sheds light on the dynamic nature of globin gene regulation in response to the space environment and provides valuable insights into the broader implications of space omics research.

"Single-cell multi-ome and immune profiles of the Inspiration4 crew reveal conserved, cell-type, and sex-specific responses to spaceflight",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166952/,"Spaceflight induces an immune response in astronauts. To better characterize this effect, we generated single-cell, multi-ome, cell-free RNA (cfRNA), biochemical, and hematology data for the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission crew. We found that 18 cytokines/chemokines related to inflammation, aging, and muscle homeostasis changed after spaceflight. In I4 single-cell multi-omics data, we identified a “spaceflight signature” of gene expression characterized by enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation, UV response, immune function, and TCF21 pathways. We confirmed the presence of this signature in independent datasets, including the NASA Twins Study, the I4 skin spatial transcriptomics, and 817 NASA GeneLab mouse transcriptomes. Finally, we observed that (1) T cells showed an up-regulation of FOXP3, (2) MHC class I genes exhibited long-term suppression, and (3) infection-related immune pathways were associated with microbiome shifts. In summary, this study reveals conserved and distinct immune disruptions occurring and details a roadmap for potential countermeasures to preserve astronaut health.

Single-cell analysis identifies conserved features of immune dysfunction in simulated microgravity and spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166937/,"Microgravity is associated with immunological dysfunction, though the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, using single-cell analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to short term (25 hours) simulated microgravity, we characterize altered genes and pathways at basal and stimulated states with a Toll-like Receptor-7/8 agonist. We validate single-cell analysis by RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy, and against data from the Inspiration-4 (I4) mission, JAXA (Cell-Free Epigenome) mission, Twins study, and spleens from mice on the International Space Station. Overall, microgravity alters specific pathways for optimal immunity, including the cytoskeleton, interferon signaling, pyroptosis, temperature-shock, innate inflammation (e.g., Coronavirus pathogenesis pathway and IL-6 signaling), nuclear receptors, and sirtuin signaling. Microgravity directs monocyte inflammatory parameters, and impairs T cell and NK cell functionality. Using machine learning, we identify numerous compounds linking microgravity to immune cell transcription, and demonstrate that the flavonol, quercetin, can reverse most abnormal pathways. These results define immune cell alterations in microgravity, and provide opportunities for countermeasures to maintain normal immunity in space.

The Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) and international astronaut biobank,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11357981/,"Spaceflight induces molecular, cellular and physiological shifts in astronauts and poses myriad biomedical challenges to the human body, which are becoming increasingly relevant as more humans venture into space 1 – 6 . Yet current frameworks for aerospace medicine are nascent and lag far behind advancements in precision medicine on Earth, underscoring the need for rapid development of space medicine databases, tools and protocols. Here we present the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), an integrated data and sample repository for clinical, cellular and multi-omic research profiles from a diverse range of missions, including the NASA Twins Study 7 , JAXA CFE study 8 , 9 , SpaceX Inspiration4 crew 10 – 12 , Axiom and Polaris. The SOMA resource represents a more than tenfold increase in publicly available human space omics data, with matched samples available from the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank. The Atlas includes extensive molecular and physiological profiles encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiome datasets, which reveal some consistent features across missions, including cytokine shifts, telomere elongation and gene expression changes, as well as mission-specific molecular responses and links to orthologous, tissue-specific mouse datasets. Leveraging the datasets, tools and resources in SOMA can help to accelerate precision aerospace medicine, bringing needed health monitoring, risk mitigation and countermeasure data for upcoming lunar, Mars and exploration-class missions.

"Secretome profiling reveals acute changes in oxidative stress, brain homeostasis, and coagulation following short-duration spaceflight",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166969/,"As spaceflight becomes more common with commercial crews, blood-based measures of crew health can guide both astronaut biomedicine and countermeasures. By profiling plasma proteins, metabolites, and extracellular vesicles/particles (EVPs) from the SpaceX Inspiration4 crew, we generated “spaceflight secretome profiles,” which showed significant differences in coagulation, oxidative stress, and brain-enriched proteins. While >93% of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in vesicles and metabolites recovered within six months, the majority (73%) of plasma DAPs were still perturbed post-flight. Moreover, these proteomic alterations correlated better with peripheral blood mononuclear cells than whole blood, suggesting that immune cells contribute more DAPs than erythrocytes. Finally, to discern possible mechanisms leading to brain-enriched protein detection and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, we examined protein changes in dissected brains of spaceflight mice, which showed increases in PECAM-1, a marker of BBB integrity.

Astronaut omics and the impact of space on the human body at scale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166943/,"Future multi-year crewed planetary missions will motivate advances in aerospace nutrition and telehealth. On Earth, the Human Cell Atlas project aims to spatially map all cell types in the human body. Here, we propose that a parallel Human Cell Space Atlas could serve as an openly available, global resource for space life science research. As humanity becomes increasingly spacefaring, high-resolution omics on orbit could permit an advent of precision spaceflight healthcare. Alongside the scientific potential, we consider the complex ethical, cultural, and legal challenges intrinsic to the human space omics discipline, and how philosophical frameworks may benefit from international perspectives.

"Cosmic kidney disease: an integrated pan-omic, physiological and morphological study into spaceflight-induced renal dysfunction",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11167060/,"Missions into Deep Space are planned this decade. Yet the health consequences of exposure to microgravity and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) over years-long missions on indispensable visceral organs such as the kidney are largely unexplored. We performed biomolecular (epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, epiproteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic), clinical chemistry (electrolytes, endocrinology, biochemistry) and morphometry (histology, 3D imaging, miRNA-ISH, tissue weights) analyses using samples and datasets available from 11 spaceflight-exposed mouse and 5 human, 1 simulated microgravity rat and 4 simulated GCR-exposed mouse missions. We found that spaceflight induces: 1) renal transporter dephosphorylation which may indicate astronauts’ increased risk of nephrolithiasis is in part a primary renal phenomenon rather than solely a secondary consequence of bone loss; 2) remodelling of the nephron that results in expansion of distal convoluted tubule size but loss of overall tubule density; 3) renal damage and dysfunction when exposed to a Mars roundtrip dose-equivalent of simulated GCR.

Spaceflight induces changes in gene expression profiles linked to insulin and estrogen,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166981/,"Organismal adaptations to spaceflight have been characterized at the molecular level in model organisms, including Drosophila and C. elegans . Here, we extend molecular work to energy metabolism and sex hormone signaling in mice and humans. We found spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen signaling in rodents and humans. Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways. Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful interplanetary species.

Growth chambers on the International Space Station for large plants,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10780891/,"Planning long-term space flights necessarily includes issues of providing food for the crew. One of the areas of research is the development of technologies for independent production of food by the crew. Extensive research on lettuce has confirmed that the “space production” of lettuce is not inferior to that on Earth, even in the absence of gravity, but the same deep understanding of the quality of grain crops has not yet been achieved. Therefore, the goal of our work is to establish whether the conditions for growing wheat in outer space without gravity affect the weight and basic parameters of the grain, and whether this leads to increased asymmetry of the kernel and distortion of the starch composition. The objects of the study were wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) kernels of the Super Dwarf cultivar. Of which, 100 kernels matured in outer space conditions in the Lada growth chamber on the International Space Station (ISS), and 85 kernels of the control wheat grown in a similar growth chamber under terrestrial conditions. It has been established that kernels from ISS have significant differences to a smaller extent in weight, area, length, and width of the kernel. However, the kernels under both conditions were predominantly large (the average weight of a kernel in space is 0.0362 g, and in terrestrial conditions—0.0376 g). The hypothesis that the level of fluctuating asymmetry will increase in outer space was not confirmed; significant differences between the options were not proven. In general, the kernels are fairly even (coefficients of variation for the main parameters of the kernel are within 6–12%) and with a low or very low level of asymmetry. The length of starch granules of type A in filled and puny kernels is significantly greater in kernels from ISS than in the control, and in terms of the width of starch granules B and roundness indices, both experimental variants are the same. It can be assumed that the baking qualities of earthly kernels will be slightly higher, since the ratio of type B starch granules to type A is 5–8% higher than on the ISS. Also, the width of the aleurone layer cells in mature kernels was significantly inferior to the result obtained on Earth. The work proposes a new method for establishing the asymmetry of kernels without a traumatic effect (in early works, it was supposed to study asymmetry in transverse sections of the kernels). Perhaps this will make it possible to further develop a computer scanning program that will determine the level of asymmetry of the wheat fruit.

Microbiological and nutritional analysis of lettuce crops grown on the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7067979/,"The ability to grow safe, fresh food to supplement packaged foods of astronauts in space has been an important goal for NASA. Food crops grown in space experience different environmental conditions than plants grown on Earth (e.g., reduced gravity, elevated radiation levels). To study the effects of space conditions, red romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa cv ‘Outredgeous,’ plants were grown in Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared with ground-grown plants. Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Ground controls were grown simultaneously with a 24–72 h delay using ISS environmental data. Food safety of the plants was determined by heterotrophic plate counts for bacteria and fungi, as well as isolate identification using samples taken from the leaves and roots. Molecular characterization was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to provide taxonomic composition and phylogenetic structure of the community. Leaves were also analyzed for elemental composition, as well as levels of phenolics, anthocyanins, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Comparison of flight and ground tissues showed some differences in total counts for bacteria and yeast/molds (2.14 – 4.86 log 10 CFU/g), while screening for select human pathogens yielded negative results. Bacterial and fungal isolate identification and community characterization indicated variation in the diversity of genera between leaf and root tissue with diversity being higher in root tissue, and included differences in the dominant genera. The only difference between ground and flight experiments was seen in the third experiment, VEG-03A, with significant differences in the genera from leaf tissue. Flight and ground tissue showed differences in Fe, K, Na, P, S, and Zn content and total phenolic levels, but no differences in anthocyanin and ORAC levels. This study indicated that leafy vegetable crops can produce safe, edible, fresh food to supplement to the astronauts’ diet, and provide baseline data for continual operation of the Veggie plant growth units on ISS.

Natural variation in the expression of ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 affects root length responses to cadaverine in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4321547/,"Polyamines, including cadaverine, are organic cations that affect numerous biological processes including transcription, translation, cell signalling, and ion channel activity. They often function in biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants. Because little is known about how plants respond to cadaverine, a quantitative natural variation approach was used to identify genetic factors that contribute to this response. Here it is shown that Arabidopsis thaliana accessions have varying root length responses to exogenous cadaverine: Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) was one of the most resistant accessions tested, whereas Landsberg erecta (L er ) was one of the most sensitive. Recombinant inbred lines, near isogenic lines, and a microarray were used to show that variation in ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 ( OCT1 ) is at least partially responsible for this difference. OCT1 expression was higher in Cvi than in L er , and oct1 mutants were more sensitive to cadaverine than wild-type plants. In oct1 mutants transformed with an ectopic copy of OCT1 originating from either Cvi or L er , the expression level of the transgene, not its accession, correlated with the cadaverine response. These results suggest that decreased OCT1 expression confers cadaverine sensitivity in some accessions.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-jexbot.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f376/4321547/30c89cd47a75/exbotj_eru444_f0001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f376/4321547/3afea3e24766/exbotj_eru444_f0002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f376/4321547/060a6f43f6a8/exbotj_eru444_f0003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f376/4321547/93c6bb89fd8d/exbotj_eru444_f0004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f376/4321547/66511d261467/exbotj_eru444_f0005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f376/4321547/d05372365ee9/exbotj_eru444_f0006.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Auxin: Shape matters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6710492/,"We evaluated the effect of AsiMax 50®, a commercial formulation of 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), on the structure of both micro + nano phytoplankton (>2 μm; species composition and abundance) and cytometric populations (photosynthetic picoplankton (PPP, 0.2–2 μm), which included prokaryotic phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria (PC-Pcy), phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (PE-Pcy) and eukaryotic phototrophs (PEuk); and bacterioplankton (HB), heterotrophic bacteria), using a microcosms-based approach and a single 7-day exposure. Assays were performed on two different microbial assemblages sampled from freshwater bodies of two contrasting turbidity status: clear (chlorophyll a = 7.6 μgL -1 , turbidity = 1 NTU) and organic turbid systems (chlorophyll a = 25.0 μgL -1 , turbidity = 9 NTU). For each system, the herbicide was applied to 500 mL-Erlenmeyer flasks, at seven concentration levels of the active ingredient (a.i.): 0 (control = no addition), 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 2,000 mg a.i.L −1 . The impact of AsiMax 50® seemed to be greater in the turbid system. In this system, total abundance of living (live) micro + nano phytoplankton showed a significant increase at lower concentrations and data were fitted to a humped-shaped curve. For both clear and organic turbid systems, micro + nano phytoplankton decreased in species richness and abundance at higher herbicide concentrations. These results suggest that 2,4-D may mimic hormonal function. Some species, such as Ochromonas sp. and Chlamydomonas sp., showed different responses to herbicide exposure between water systems. In the turbid system, the increase in abundance of the PPP fraction observed at 7-d exposure was probably due to either an increase in PE-Pcy (thus suggesting the existence of auxin pathways) or a reduction in competitive pressure by micro + nano plankton. Our results provide some evidence of the importance of using community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological studies to predict changes in freshwater ecosystems exposed to a 2,4-D-based formulation. However, caution must be taken when extrapolating these effects to real scenarios, as assays were based on a laboratory microcosm experiment.

Gravity signaling in flowering plant roots,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12008199/,"Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires tightly regulated phytohormone signaling. Here, we isolate a rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 ( CRW1 ) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism.

Low-speed clinorotation of Brachypodium distachyon and Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings triggers root tip curvatures that are reminiscent of gravitropism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9861679/,"Clinostats are instruments that continuously rotate biological specimens along an axis, thereby averaging their orientation relative to gravity over time. Our previous experiments indicated that low-speed clinorotation may itself trigger directional root tip curvature. In this project, we have investigated the root curvature response to low-speed clinorotation using Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon seedlings as models. We show that low-speed clinorotation triggers root tip curvature in which direction is dictated by gravitropism during the first half-turn of clinorotation. We also show that the angle of root tip curvature is modulated by the speed of clinorotation. Arabidopsis mutations affecting gravity susception ( pgm ) or gravity signal transduction ( arg1 , toc132 ) are shown to affect the root tip curvature response to low-speed clinorotation. Furthermore, low-speed vertical clinorotation triggers relocalization of the PIN3 auxin efflux facilitator to the lateral membrane of Arabidopsis root cap statocytes, and creates a lateral gradient of auxin across the root tip. Together, these observations support a role for gravitropism in modulating root curvature responses to clinorotation. Interestingly, distinct Brachypodium distachyon accessions display different abilities to develop root tip curvature responses to low-speed vertical clinorotation, suggesting the possibility of using genome-wide association studies to further investigate this process.

New device for high-throughput viability screening of flow biofilms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897429/,"Control of biofilms requires rapid methods to identify compounds effective against them and to isolate resistance-compromised mutants for identifying genes involved in enhanced biofilm resistance. While rapid screening methods for microtiter plate well (“static”) biofilms are available, there are no methods for such screening of continuous flow biofilms (“flow biofilms”). Since the latter biofilms more closely approximate natural biofilms, development of a high-throughput (HTP) method for screening them is desirable. We describe here a new method using a device comprised of microfluidic channels and a distributed pneumatic pump (BioFlux) that provides fluid flow to 96 individual biofilms. This device allows fine control of continuous or intermittent fluid flow over a broad range of flow rates, and the use of a standard well plate format provides compatibility with plate readers. We show that use of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing bacteria, staining with propidium iodide, and measurement of fluorescence with a plate reader permit rapid and accurate determination of biofilm viability. The biofilm viability measured with the plate reader agreed with that determined using plate counts, as well as with the results of fluorescence microscope image analysis. Using BioFlux and the plate reader, we were able to rapidly screen the effects of several antimicrobials on the viability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 flow biofilms.
Bacterial biofilms are surface-attached communities that are encased in a polymeric matrix, which exhibit a high degree of resistance to antimicrobial agents and the host immune system ( 12 , 16 ). This makes them medically important; diseases with a biofilm component are chronic and difficult to eradicate. Examples of such diseases are cystitis ( 1 ), endocarditis ( 31 ), cystic fibrosis ( 35 ), and middle-ear ( 17 ) and indwelling medical device-associated ( 20 ) infections. Biofilms also play important environmental roles in, for example, wastewater treatment ( 38 ), bioremediation ( 29 , 30 ), biofouling ( 7 ), and biocorrosion ( 2 ). Better control of biofilms requires elucidation of the molecular basis of their superior resistance (by identifying resistance-compromised mutants) and identification of compounds with antibiofilm activity. While our understanding of these aspects of biofilms has increased ( 11 , 15 , 25 - 27 , 36 ), further work, including development of accurate high-throughput (HTP) methods for screening biofilm viability, is needed.
Two major biofilm models are studied in the laboratory, biofilms grown without a continuous flow of fresh medium and biofilms grown with a continuous flow of fresh medium; examples of these two models are microtiter well biofilms and flow cell biofilms, respectively. Methods have been developed for HTP screening of the viability of static biofilms ( 6 , 28 , 32 , 33 ), but there are no methods for HTP screening of flow biofilms. The latter biofilms are typically grown in flow cells, which have to be examined individually to determine viability and thus cannot be used for rapid screening. An HTP screening method for flow biofilms is desirable, as these biofilms more closely approximate natural biofilms and can differ from static biofilms evidently due to hydrodynamic influences on cell signaling ( 22 , 34 ). For example, the ability of rpoS -deficient Escherichia coli (lacking σ S ) to form flow biofilms is impaired, but its capacity to form biofilms under static conditions is enhanced ( 18 ).
We describe here a new application of a recently developed device ( 8 - 10 , 13 ), the “BioFlux” device consisting of microfluidic channels for biofilm growth. Other microfluidic devices have recently been used for biofilm formation ( 14 , 19 , 21 , 23 ), but none of them has been used for HTP screening. The BioFlux device permits rapid measurement of the fluorescence of flow biofilms with a plate reader, which permits initial HTP screening of the viability of such biofilms.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-aem.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d0fd/2897429/f24bbbb243f9/zam9991010750001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d0fd/2897429/d6de215f5d6c/zam9991010750005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d0fd/2897429/98dc5e31b8f0/zam9991010750002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d0fd/2897429/19da03bea201/zam9991010750003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d0fd/2897429/1de68c615ecd/zam9991010750004.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Sigma S-dependent antioxidant defense protects stationary-phase Escherichia coli against the bactericidal antibiotic gentamicin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4187989/,"Stationary-phase bacteria are important in disease. The σ s -regulated general stress response helps them become resistant to disinfectants, but the role of σ s in bacterial antibiotic resistance has not been elucidated. Loss of σ s rendered stationary-phase Escherichia coli more sensitive to the bactericidal antibiotic gentamicin (Gm), and proteomic analysis suggested involvement of a weakened antioxidant defense. Use of the p sfiA genetic reporter, 3′-( p -hydroxyphenyl) fluorescein (HPF) dye, and Amplex Red showed that Gm generated more reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mutant. HPF measurements can be distorted by cell elongation, but Gm did not affect stationary-phase cell dimensions. Coadministration of the antioxidant N -acetyl cysteine (NAC) decreased drug lethality particularly in the mutant, as did Gm treatment under anaerobic conditions that prevent ROS formation. Greater oxidative stress, due to insufficient quenching of endogenous ROS and/or respiration-linked electron leakage, therefore contributed to the greater sensitivity of the mutant; infection by a uropathogenic strain in mice showed this to be the case also in vivo . Disruption of antioxidant defense by eliminating the quencher proteins, SodA/SodB and KatE/SodA, or the pentose phosphate pathway proteins, Zwf/Gnd and TalA, which provide NADPH for ROS decomposition, also generated greater oxidative stress and killing by Gm. Thus, besides its established mode of action, Gm also kills stationary-phase bacteria by generating oxidative stress, and targeting the antioxidant defense of E. coli can enhance its efficacy. Relevant aspects of the current controversy on the role of ROS in killing by bactericidal drugs of exponential-phase bacteria, which represent a different physiological state, are discussed.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-aac.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5f1c/4187989/374f9b518b70/zac0101433050001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5f1c/4187989/152409d34506/zac0101433050002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5f1c/4187989/c3b2e1b60021/zac0101433050003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5f1c/4187989/ab8bcd1f302f/zac0101433050004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5f1c/4187989/91cf95f0ac67/zac0101433050005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5f1c/4187989/9fdb6307b36c/zac0101433050006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5f1c/4187989/1e27741f23aa/zac0101433050007.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Plasma membrane disruption (PMD) formation and repair in mechanosensitive tissues,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8217198/,"Mammalian cells employ an array of biological mechanisms to detect and respond to mechanical loading in their environment. One such mechanism is the formation of plasma membrane disruptions (PMD), which foster a molecular flux across cell membranes that promotes tissue adaptation. Repair of PMD through an orchestrated activity of molecular machinery is critical for cell survival, and the rate of PMD repair can affect downstream cellular signaling. PMD have been observed to influence the mechanical behavior of skin, alveolar, and gut epithelial cells, aortic endothelial cells, corneal keratocytes and epithelial cells, cardiac and skeletal muscle myocytes, neurons, and most recently, bone cells including osteoblasts, periodontal ligament cells, and osteocytes. PMD are therefore positioned to affect the physiological behavior of a wide range of vertebrate organ systems including skeletal and cardiac muscle, skin, eyes, the gastrointestinal tract, the vasculature, the respiratory system, and the skeleton. The purpose of this review is to describe the processes of PMD formation and repair across these mechanosensitive tissues, with a particular emphasis on comparing and contrasting repair mechanisms and downstream signaling to better understand the role of PMD in skeletal mechanobiology.

Response of the mouse sublingual gland to spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6131065/,"The ultrastructure and immunohistochemistry of secretory proteins of sublingual glands were studied in mice flown on the US space shuttles Discovery (Space Transportation System [STS]-131) and Atlantis (STS-135). No differences in mucous acinar or serous demilune cell structure were observed between sublingual glands of ground control and flight mice. In contrast, previous studies showed autophagy and apoptosis of parotid serous acinar cells in flight mice. The expression of parotid secretory protein (PSP) in sublingual demilune cells of STS-131 flight mice was significantly increased compared to ground control mice but decreased in STS-135 flight mice. Similarly, mucin (Muc19) expression in acinar cells and PKA-RII expression in demilune cells were increased in STS-131 flight mice and decreased in STS-135 flight mice, but not significantly. Demilune cell and parotid protein (DCPP) was slightly decreased in mice from both flights, and nuclear PKA-RII was slightly increased. These results indicate that the response of salivary glands to spaceflight conditions varies among the different glands, cell types and secretory proteins. Additionally, the spaceflight environment, including the effects of microgravity, modifies protein expression. Determining changes in salivary proteins may lead to development of non-invasive methods to assess the physiological status of astronauts.

Human history in space began in the 1960s and has expanded since then. Advancements in space technology have made it possible to answer some of the questions about distant planets and have generated interest in possible human missions to explore these worlds. To carry out these missions, however, requires a more complete understanding the effects of spaceflight and microgravity on biological processes. There are a number of ways to obtain microgravity-associated data including actual spaceflight missions and ground-based studies that simulate weightlessness (bed rest models, hindlimb suspension models, clinostats). However, spaceflight is a unique environment which cannot be totally duplicated.
Rodents are the most used animal model in space research, although primates as well as cold-blooded vertebrates and invertebrates also have been flown in space ( 1 ). Rodents have advantages over other animals due to their small size, structural and functional similarities to humans, ease of maintenance, and less expense.
Previous studies revealed that bone loss, decreased immune system function, alterations in gastrointestinal microbial flora and cardiovascular deconditioning are major consequences of weightlessness on biological systems ( 2 – 5 ). Spaceflight also affects oral hard and soft tissues. Limited information is available about the effects of microgravity on oral tissues including the mandible and teeth ( 6 – 9 ), salivary glands ( 10 – 13 ) and saliva ( 14 ).
Salivary glands and their secretions can be used to study environmentally-induced changes in cellular and molecular processes by measuring secretory proteins that are specific cell type markers or are indicators of specific cell functions. Saliva from the major and minor salivary glands contains proteins that can serve as indicators of an organism’s systemic physiology and pathology ( 15 ). Our previous studies of the rodent parotid gland showed specific structural and molecular alterations following spaceflight ( 10 – 13 ). The parotid gland is a pure serous gland, secreting a variety of proteins and glycoproteins with diverse functions. In contrast, the sublingual gland consists predominantly of mucous cells, with a few serous demilune cells. The main product of the sublingual gland is mucin, with a smaller contribution of proteins and glycoproteins from the demilune cells.
Based on the working hypothesis that microgravity modifies ultrastructure and protein expression, it should be possible to measure such changes in the sublingual glands of mice flown on two US space shuttle missions. This study was designed to determine structural changes in the mouse sublingual gland using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), to determine cellular distribution and expression of selected sublingual gland proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and to compare these changes to those observed in the parotid gland.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-nihpa.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f0c4/6131065/4d71db9eb001/nihms970068f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f0c4/6131065/d6c6696fa012/nihms970068f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f0c4/6131065/8f3fef0a9ba5/nihms970068f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f0c4/6131065/69d91aface2d/nihms970068f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f0c4/6131065/ae67aa906d72/nihms970068f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f0c4/6131065/6d49dcecccb0/nihms970068f6.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Effects of spaceflight on the mouse submandibular gland,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11233762/,"Introduction: Space is a unique environment characterized by isolation from community life and exposure to circadian misalignment, microgravity, and space radiation. These multiple differences from those experienced on the earth may cause systemic and local tissue stress. Autonomic nerves, including sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, regulate functions in multiple organs. Saliva is secreted from the salivary gland, which is regulated by autonomic nerves, and plays several important roles in the oral cavity and digestive processes. The balance of the autonomic nervous system in the seromucous glands, such as the submandibular glands, precisely controls serous and mucous saliva. Psychological stress, radiation damage, and other triggers can cause an imbalance in salivary secretion systems. A previous study reported that amylase is a stress marker in behavioral medicine and space flight crews; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying amylase regulation in the space environment are still unknown.
Methods: In this study, we aimed to elucidate how lunar gravity (1/6 g ) changes mRNA expression patterns in the salivary gland. Using a multiple artificial gravity research system during space flight in the International Space Station, we studied the effects of two different gravitational levels, lunar and Earth gravity, on the submandibular glands of mice. All mice survived, returned to Earth from space, and their submandibular glands were collected 2 days after landing.
Results: We found that lunar gravity induced the expression of the salivary amylase gene Amy1 ; however, no increase in Aqp5 and Ano1 , which regulate water secretion, was observed. In addition, genes involved in the exocrine system, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 ( Vamp8 ) and small G proteins, including Rap1 and Rab families, were upregulated under lunar gravity.
Conclusion: These results imply that lunar gravity upregulates salivary amylase secretion via Rap / Rab signaling and exocytosis via Vamp8 . Our study highlights Amy1 as a potential candidate marker for stress regulation in salivary glands in the lunar gravity environment.

"Reactivation of Latent Epstein-Barr Virus: A Comparison after Exposure to Gamma, Proton, Carbon, and Iron Radiation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213004/,"Among the many stressors astronauts are exposed to during spaceflight, cosmic radiation may lead to various serious health effects. Specifically, space radiation may contribute to decreased immunity, which has been documented in astronauts during short- and long-duration missions, as evidenced by several changes in cellular immunity and plasma cytokine levels. Reactivation of latent herpes viruses, either directly from radiation of latently infected cells and/or from perturbation of the immune system, may result in disease in astronauts. Epstein‒Barr virus (EBV) is one of the eight human herpes viruses known to infect more than 90% of human adults and persists for the life of the host without normally causing adverse effects. Reactivation of several latent viruses in astronauts is well documented, although the mechanism of reactivation is not well understood. We studied the effect of four different types of radiation, (1) 137 Cs gamma rays, (2) 150-MeV protons, (3) 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and (4) 600 MeV/n iron ions on the activation of lytic gene transcription and of reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line (Akata) at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. The data showed that for all doses used in this study, lytic gene transcription was induced and median viral loads were significantly higher for all types of radiation than in corresponding control samples, with the increases detected as early as four days post-exposure and generally tapering off at later time points. The viability and size of EBV-infected Akata cells were highly variable and exhibited approximately the same trend in time for all radiation types at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. This work shows that reactivation of viruses can occur due to the effect of different types of radiation on latently infected cells in the absence of changes or cytokines produced in the immune system. In general, gamma rays are more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, though these high-energy particles did induce more sustained and later reactivation of EBV lytic gene transcription.

The cyclic nucleotide-gated channel CNGC14 regulates root gravitropism in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10414970/,"Plant roots navigate in the soil environment following the gravity vector. Cell divisions in the meristem and rapid cell growth in the elongation zone propel the root tips through the soil. Actively elongating cells acidify their apoplast to enable cell wall extension by the activity of plasma membrane AHA H + -ATPases. The phytohormone auxin, central regulator of gravitropic response and root development, inhibits root cell growth, likely by rising the pH of the apoplast. However, the role of auxin in the regulation of the apoplastic pH gradient along the root tip is unclear. Here, we show, by using an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, that the Arabidopsis thaliana root surface pH shows distinct acidic and alkaline zones, which are not primarily determined by the activity of AHA H + -ATPases. Instead, the distinct domain of alkaline pH in the root transition zone is controlled by a rapid auxin response module, consisting of the AUX1 auxin influx carrier, the AFB1 auxin co-receptor, and the CNCG14 calcium channel. We demonstrate that the rapid auxin response pathway is required for an efficient navigation of the root tip.

Piezo1 regulates the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscles via orchestration of stem cell morphological states.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8932657/,"Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are essential for tissue homeostasis and regeneration, but the potential contribution of MuSC morphology to in vivo function remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that quiescent MuSCs are morphologically heterogeneous and exhibit different patterns of cellular protrusions. We classified quiescent MuSCs into three functionally distinct stem cell states: responsive, intermediate, and sensory. We demonstrate that the shift between different stem cell states promotes regeneration and is regulated by the sensing protein Piezo1. Pharmacological activation of Piezo1 is sufficient to prime MuSCs toward more responsive cells. Piezo1 deletion in MuSCs shifts the distribution toward less responsive cells, mimicking the disease phenotype we find in dystrophic muscles. We further demonstrate that Piezo1 reactivation ameliorates the MuSC morphological and regenerative defects of dystrophic muscles. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of how stem cells respond to injury and identify Piezo1 as a key regulator for adjusting stem cell states essential for regeneration.

"Impacts of radiation exposure, hindlimb unloading, and recovery on murine skeletal muscle cell telomere length.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10504369/,"Astronauts are exposed to harsh conditions, including cosmic radiation and microgravity. Spaceflight elongates human telomeres in peripheral blood, which shorten upon return to Earth and approach baseline levels during postflight recovery. Astronauts also encounter muscle atrophy, losing up to 20% loss of muscle mass on spaceflights. Telomere length changes in muscle cells of astronauts remain unexplored. This study investigates telomere alterations in grounded mice experiencing radiation exposure and muscle atrophy, via a hindlimb unloading spaceflight mimicking model. We find telomere lengthening is present in muscle stem cells and in myofiber nuclei, but not in muscle-resident endothelial cells. We further assessed telomere length in the model following hindlimb unloading recovery. We find that telomere length failed to return to baseline values. Our results suggest a role for telomeres in muscle acclimatization, which is relevant for the well-being of astronauts in space, and upon their return to Earth.

Ethylene-induced flavonol accumulation in guard cells suppresses reactive oxygen species and modulates stomatal aperture,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3982735/,"Guard cell swelling controls the aperture of stomata, pores that facilitate gas
exchange and water loss from leaves. The hormone abscisic acid ( ABA ) has a central role in regulation of stomatal closure
through synthesis of second messengers, which include reactive oxygen species ( ROS ). ROS accumulation must be minimized by antioxidants to keep concentrations
from reaching damaging levels within the cell. Flavonols are plant metabolites that
have been implicated as antioxidants; however, their antioxidant activity in planta
has been debated. Flavonols accumulate in guard cells of Arabidopsis
thaliana, but not surrounding pavement cells, as visualized with a
flavonol-specific dye. The expression of a reporter driven by the promoter of CHALCONE SYNTHASE , a gene encoding a flavonol biosynthetic
enzyme, in guard cells, but not pavement cells, suggests guard cell-specific
flavonoid synthesis. Increased levels of ROS were detected using a fluorescent ROS sensor
in guard cells of transparent testa4-2 , which has a null mutation in CHALCONE SYNTHASE and therefore synthesizes no flavonol
antioxidants. Guard cells of transparent testa4-2 show more rapid ABA -induced closure than the wild type,
suggesting that flavonols may dampen the ABA -dependent ROS burst that drives
stomatal closing. The levels of flavonols are positively regulated in guard cells by
ethylene treatment in the wild type, but not in the ethylene-insensitive2-5 mutant. In addition, in both ethylene-overproducing1 and ethylene-treated wild-type plants,
elevated flavonols lead to decreasing ROS and
slower ABA -mediated stomatal closure. These
results are consistent with flavonols suppressing ROS accumulation and decreasing the rate of ABA -dependent stomatal closure, with ethylene-induced increases
in guard cell flavonols modulating these responses.
Guard cells use an extensive signal transduction pathway to regulate the aperture of
stomata, pores on the surface of leaves that facilitate gas exchange and water loss ( Roelfsema and Hedrich, 2005 ; Joshi-Saha et al., 2011 ). CO 2 , a necessary reactant for
photosynthesis, enters leaves through stomata, whereas water can leave through these same
pores via transpiration. Excess water loss can lead to dehydration of the plant when there
is excess heat or drought. Guard cells therefore must modulate the stomatal aperture in
response to the changing environment ( Hirayama and
Shinozaki, 2007 ). In response to stimuli that close stomata, such as drought
stress, the hormone abscisic acid ( ABA ) is
increased in the cytosol of guard cells ( Zeevaart,
1980 ; Hirayama and Shinozaki (2007) ). ABA induces ion movements across the cell
membrane expelling K + and Cl − ions through ion efflux
channels. The decreased internal solute concentration drives water out of the cell via
osmosis ( Vahisalu et al., 2008 ). The loss of water
from guard cells decreases the volume of the cell, with the resulting loss of turgor
closing the stoma ( Joshi-Saha et al., 2011 ).
Additional understanding of this elegant signaling pathway will provide insight into how
plant growth and development is modulated by changes in soil moisture, temperature, and
light levels.
Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) are one important
class of signaling molecules that has been implicated in guard cell signaling ( Guan et al., 2000 ; Zhang et al., 2001 ; Jiang and Zhang,
2002 , 2003 ). The well-documented role of ROS in causing oxidative stress is now joined
with growing evidence that ROS may play integral
roles as secondary messengers in signal transduction pathways ( Wood et al., 2003 ; Rhee,
2006 ; Mittler et al., 2011 ; Munné-Bosch et al., 2013 ). At high
concentrations, ROS , such as hydrogen peroxide
( H 2 O 2 ), can cause
oxidative damage to DNA and proteins that are integral to normal cellular processes ( Asada, 2006 ; Van
Breusegem and Dat, 2006 ); however, at low levels, H 2 O 2 is an effective signaling molecule in guard
cells that can induce stomatal closure ( Pei et al.,
2000 ; Murata et al., 2001 ; Zhang et al., 2001 ; Kwak et al., 2003 ). Elevated ABA in
guard cells triggers H 2 O 2 production through activation of NADPH or respiratory burst oxidase enzymes located on the
plasma membrane ( Mustilli et al., 2002 ; Yoshida et al., 2002 ) and mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana respiratory burst oxidase D ( AtrbohD ) and AtrbohF , show impaired ABA -regulated stomatal closure ( Kwak et al., 2003 ).
The ability of signaling-regulated synthesis of H 2 O 2 to alter the activity of specific target proteins
has been shown in mammalian systems ( Rhee, 2006 ).
This oxidant, generated from superoxide O 2 .− molecules, can
modulate the activity of phosphatases and kinases, causing dynamic changes in signal
transduction pathways ( Poole et al., 2004 ).
Specifically, H 2 O 2 can
interact with specific Cys residues, transforming the functional group of the Cys into
sulfenic acid, altering formation of disulfide bonds between two separate proteins or
between nearby Cys residues of the same protein, in a transient, reversible fashion ( Poole et al., 2004 ; Poole and Nelson, 2008 ). In guard cells, this ROS burst is believed to target calcium channels to promote the influx of
calcium across the plasma membrane and the release of calcium from internal stores ( McAinsh et al., 1996 ; Allen et al., 2000 ; Cho et al.,
2009 ). Increased cytosolic calcium levels induce activation of anion efflux
channels located on the plasma membrane ( Hedrich et al.,
1990 ; Schroeder and Hagiwara, 1990 ; Chen et al., 2010 ; Wang et al., 2013 ), triggering stomatal closure. The mechanism behind ROS activation of Ca 2+ channels in
mammalian systems has been well studied ( Poole and
Nelson, 2008 ); however, less is known about this mechanism in plants.
When maintained at manageable levels, ROS are
efficient and reversible signaling molecules employed by cells to regulate the activity of
enzymes and transcription factors; however, if levels of these molecules become excessively
elevated, they can cause oxidative stress ( Hernández et al., 2009 ; Pollastri and
Tattini, 2011 ). Therefore, mechanisms that keep their levels from becoming too
high and allow their accumulation to be transient are important features of ROS signaling. ROS homeostasis is tightly regulated in plants through the production of a
variety of enzymatic and small molecule antioxidants ( Mittler et al., 2004 ). Flavonols are plant metabolites that may function as
antioxidants in plants and in animals that consume them ( Hernández et al., 2009 ). Although their antioxidant activity in planta
has been debated, previous studies have shown that the antioxidant capacity for flavonols
in vitro is greater than that of vitamin C or E, two well-documented in planta antioxidants
( Rice-Evans et al., 1997 ). Guard cells provide
an elegant system to test the antioxidant ability of flavonols, owing to the
well-documented function of ROS as a second
messenger in this cell type ( Pei et al., 2000 ; Murata et al., 2001 ; Kwak et al., 2003 ; Cho et al.,
2009 ).
This study examined the accumulation of flavonols in guard cells and the role of flavonol
accumulation in controlling the levels of ROS . A
flavonol-specific dye and a reporter construct driven by a promoter from a gene encoding a
flavonol biosynthetic enzyme revealed the localized accumulation of flavonols and the
expression of this gene that drives their synthesis in guard cells, but not in surrounding
pavement cells. Mutants that make no flavonols are used to demonstrate the specificity of
the flavonol-specific dye, and to show the effect of flavonols on ROS status and stomatal aperture. Finally, the induction of flavonol
synthesis in guard cells in response to ethylene was examined, as well as the effect of
these regulated changes in flavonol concentration on stomatal aperture. These results
indicate that flavonols suppress ROS levels within
guard cell modulating stomatal aperture and with changing environmental conditions
modulating flavonol synthesis and guard cell signaling.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plntphys.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3ee3/3982735/35d2df7c3a90/pp_233528_f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3ee3/3982735/126b8c69d9c6/pp_233528_f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3ee3/3982735/821161784b86/pp_233528_f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3ee3/3982735/356104b7a8dd/pp_233528_f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3ee3/3982735/612188f3a681/pp_233528_f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3ee3/3982735/172e1287d165/pp_233528_f6.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3ee3/3982735/e3a4e1aac437/pp_233528_f7.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3ee3/3982735/1aa577757fbd/pp_233528_f8.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Transcriptional and Hormonal Regulation of Gravitropism of Woody Stems in Populus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4682325/,"Angiosperm trees reorient their woody stems by asymmetrically producing a specialized xylem tissue, tension wood, which exerts a strong contractile force resulting in negative gravitropism of the stem. Here, we show, in Populus trees, that initial gravity perception and response occurs in specialized cells through sedimentation of starch-filled amyloplasts and relocalization of the auxin transport protein, PIN3. Gibberellic acid treatment stimulates the rate of tension wood formation and gravibending and enhances tissue-specific expression of an auxin-responsive reporter. Gravibending, maturation of contractile fibers, and gibberellic acid ( GA ) stimulation of tension wood formation are all sensitive to transcript levels of the Class I KNOX homeodomain transcription factor-encoding gene ARBORKNOX2 ( ARK2 ). We generated genome-wide transcriptomes for trees in which gene expression was perturbed by gravistimulation, GA treatment, and modulation of ARK2 expression. These data were employed in computational analyses to model the transcriptional networks underlying wood formation, including identification and dissection of gene coexpression modules associated with wood phenotypes, GA response, and ARK2 binding to genes within modules. We propose a model for gravitropism in the woody stem in which the peripheral location of PIN3-expressing cells relative to the cambium results in auxin transport toward the cambium in the top of the stem, triggering tension wood formation, while transport away from the cambium in the bottom of the stem triggers opposite wood formation.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plntcell.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e337/4682325/cd6a6250ce02/PC_TPC201500531RAR1_f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e337/4682325/286b6b740f14/PC_TPC201500531RAR1_f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e337/4682325/87a83ee5228d/PC_TPC201500531RAR1_f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e337/4682325/06fc0f7c1685/PC_TPC201500531RAR1_f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e337/4682325/276e33be09c1/PC_TPC201500531RAR1_f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e337/4682325/3398d9cf1e2c/PC_TPC201500531RAR1_f6.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Endosidin2 targets conserved exocyst complex subunit EXO70 to inhibit exocytosis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10264680/,"To sustain normal growth and allow rapid responses to environmental cues, plants alter the plasma membrane protein composition under different conditions presumably by regulation of delivery, stability, and internalization. Exocytosis is a conserved cellular process that delivers proteins and lipids to the plasma membrane or extracellular space in eukaryotes. The octameric exocyst complex contributes to exocytosis by tethering secretory vesicles to the correct site for membrane fusion; however, whether the exocyst complex acts universally for all secretory vesicle cargo or just for specialized subsets used during polarized growth and trafficking is currently unknown. In addition to its role in exocytosis, the exocyst complex is also known to participate in membrane recycling and autophagy. Using a previously identified small molecule inhibitor of the plant exocyst complex subunit EXO70A1, Endosidin2 (ES2), combined with a plasma membrane enrichment method and quantitative proteomic analysis, we examined the composition of plasma membrane proteins in the root of Arabidopsis seedlings, after inhibition of the ES2-targetted exocyst complex, and verified our findings by live imaging of GFP-tagged plasma membrane proteins in root epidermal cells. The abundance of 145 plasma membrane proteins was significantly reduced following short-term ES2 treatments and these likely represent candidate cargo proteins of exocyst-mediated trafficking. Gene Ontology analysis showed that these proteins play diverse functions in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress response, membrane transport, and nutrient uptake. Additionally, we quantified the effect of ES2 on the spatial distribution of EXO70A1 with live-cell imaging. Our results indicate that the plant exocyst complex mediates constitutive dynamic transport of subsets of plasma membrane proteins during normal root growth.

"A conditional mutation in SCD1 reveals linkage between PIN protein trafficking, auxin transport, gravitropism, and lateral root initiation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7358545/,"Auxin is transported in plants with distinct polarity, defined by transport proteins of the PIN-formed (PIN) family. Components of the complex trafficking machinery responsible for polar PIN protein localization have been identified by genetic approaches, but severe developmental phenotypes of trafficking mutants complicate dissection of this pathway. We utilized a temperature sensitive allele of Arabidopsis thaliana SCD1 ( stomatal cytokinesis defective1 ) that encodes a RAB-guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Auxin transport, lateral root initiation, asymmetric auxin-induced gene expression after gravitropic reorientation, and differential gravitropic growth were reduced in the roots of the scd1-1 mutant relative to wild type at the restrictive temperature of 25°C, but not at the permissive temperature of 18°C. In scd1-1 at 25°C, PIN1- and PIN2-GFP accumulated in endomembrane bodies. Transition of seedlings from 18 to 25°C for as little as 20 min resulted in the accumulation of PIN2-GFP in endomembranes, while gravitropism and root developmental defects were not detected until hours after transition to the non-permissive temperature. The endomembrane compartments that accumulated PIN2-GFP in scd1-1 exhibited FM4-64 signal colocalized with ARA7 and ARA6 fluorescent marker proteins, consistent with PIN2 accumulation in the late or multivesicular endosome. These experiments illustrate the power of using a temperature sensitive mutation in the gene encoding SCD1 to study the trafficking of PIN2 between the endosome and the plasma membrane. Using the conditional feature of this mutation, we show that altered trafficking of PIN2 precedes altered auxin transport and defects in gravitropism and lateral root development in this mutant upon transition to the restrictive temperature.

Changes in nuclear shape and gene expression in response to simulated microgravity are LINC complex-dependent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7555797/,"Microgravity is known to affect the organization of the cytoskeleton, cell and nuclear morphology and to elicit differential expression of genes associated with the cytoskeleton, focal adhesions and the extracellular matrix. Although the nucleus is mechanically connected to the cytoskeleton through the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, the role of this group of proteins in these responses to microgravity has yet to be defined. In our study, we used a simulated microgravity device, a 3-D clinostat (Gravite), to investigate whether the LINC complex mediates cellular responses to the simulated microgravity environment. We show that nuclear shape and differential gene expression are both responsive to simulated microgravity in a LINC-dependent manner and that this response changes with the duration of exposure to simulated microgravity. These LINC-dependent genes likely represent elements normally regulated by the mechanical forces imposed by gravity on Earth.

"Growth of Carnobacterium spp. from permafrost under low pressure, temperature, and anoxic atmosphere has implications for Earth microbes on Mars",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3545801/,"The ability of terrestrial microorganisms to grow in the near-surface environment of Mars is of importance to the search for life and protection of that planet from forward contamination by human and robotic exploration. Because most water on present-day Mars is frozen in the regolith, permafrosts are considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian subsurface environment. Six bacterial isolates were obtained from a permafrost borehole in northeastern Siberia capable of growth under conditions of low temperature (0 °C), low pressure (7 mbar), and a CO 2 -enriched anoxic atmosphere. By 16S ribosomal DNA analysis, all six permafrost isolates were identified as species of the genus Carnobacterium , most closely related to C. inhibens (five isolates) and C. viridans (one isolate). Quantitative growth assays demonstrated that the six permafrost isolates, as well as nine type species of Carnobacterium ( C. alterfunditum , C. divergens , C. funditum , C. gallinarum , C. inhibens , C. maltaromaticum , C. mobile , C. pleistocenium , and C. viridans ) were all capable of growth under cold, low-pressure, anoxic conditions, thus extending the low-pressure extreme at which life can function.
Keywords: astrobiology, planetary protection
A central goal of astrobiology is to explore the limits at which life can occur and to search for life and habitable locations outside Earth ( 1 ). The planet Mars is considered a promising astrobiological exploration target owing to its relative proximity and similarity to Earth, coupled with increasing evidence pointing to the past and present existence of liquid water at the surface and near subsurface ( 2 – 4 ). The current surface environment of Mars presents formidable challenges to life, such as a scarcity of liquid water and organic nutrients, extreme low temperatures, a low-pressure CO 2 -dominated atmosphere, harsh solar and galactic cosmic radiation, and a lack of organic nutrients ( 5 ). To address the question of whether terrestrial life could survive and grow in the martian environment, several researchers have turned to Mars environmental simulations conducted in chambers that replicate the temperature, pressure, atmospheric composition, regolith composition, and solar radiation environment of the Mars surface and near subsurface ( 6 ). Results from past experiments testing the ability of dozens of terrestrial microorganisms to grow in one such simulator demonstrated that the combination of low pressure (P; 7 mbar), low temperature (T; 0 °C), and anoxic atmosphere (A), called here low-PTA conditions, posed significant barriers to growth ( 5 , 7 , 8 ).
Because much of the water on present-day Mars exists in a permanently frozen state mixed with mineral matrix, permafrosts on Earth are considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian environment ( 9 ). On the basis of similarities between martian regolith and terrestrial permafrost, we reasoned that permafrost might contain microbes capable of growth under low-PTA conditions. In this communication we report that screening of ca . 10,000 microbes obtained from four Siberian permafrost samples resulted in the isolation of six bacterial strains capable of growth under low-PTA conditions, and that all of these isolates belonged to the Gram-positive genus Carnobacterium .","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-pnas.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b40e/3545801/448a7d849d3b/pnas.1209793110fig01.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b40e/3545801/e69c718ae0a9/pnas.1209793110fig02.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b40e/3545801/baa4b0d89936/pnas.1209793110fig03.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b40e/3545801/a5ac2033abb0/pnas.1209793110fig04.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b40e/3545801/09e09ae8e94f/pnas.1209793110fig05.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/b40e/3545801/2697dc86ac76/pnas.1209793110uneq1.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

"Exposure of Bacillus subtilis to low pressure (5 kilopascals) induces several global regulons, including those involved in the SigB-mediated general stress response",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4135744/,"Studies of how microorganisms respond to pressure have been limited mostly to the extreme high pressures of the deep sea (i.e., the piezosphere). In contrast, despite the fact that the growth of most bacteria is inhibited at pressures below ∼2.5 kPa, little is known of microbial responses to low pressure (LP). To study the global LP response, we performed transcription microarrays on Bacillus subtilis cells grown under normal atmospheric pressure (∼101 kPa) and a nearly inhibitory LP (5 kPa), equivalent to the pressure found at an altitude of ∼20 km. Microarray analysis revealed altered levels of 363 transcripts belonging to several global regulons (AbrB, CcpA, CodY, Fur, IolR, ResD, Rok, SigH, Spo0A). Notably, the highest number of upregulated genes, 86, belonged to the SigB-mediated general stress response (GSR) regulon. Upregulation of the GSR by LP was confirmed by monitoring the expression of the SigB-dependent ctc-lacZ reporter fusion. Measuring transcriptome changes resulting from exposure of bacterial cells to LP reveals insights into cellular processes that may respond to LP exposure.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-aem.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5800/4135744/31f025426f1b/zam9991055420001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5800/4135744/34f08327df9e/zam9991055420002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5800/4135744/6ab3ccb41a9b/zam9991055420003.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
"Resistance of Bacillus subtilis Spore DNA to Lethal Ionizing Radiation Damage Relies Primarily on Spore Core Components and DNA Repair, with Minor Effects of Oxygen Radical Detoxification",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3911009/,"The roles of various core components, including α/β/γ-type small acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP), dipicolinic acid (DPA), core water content, and DNA repair by apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), in Bacillus subtilis spore resistance to different types of ionizing radiation including X rays, protons, and high-energy charged iron ions have been studied. Spores deficient in DNA repair by NHEJ or AP endonucleases, the oxidative stress response, or protection by major α/β-type SASP, DPA, and decreased core water content were significantly more sensitive to ionizing radiation than wild-type spores, with highest sensitivity to high-energy-charged iron ions. DNA repair via NHEJ and AP endonucleases appears to be the most important mechanism for spore resistance to ionizing radiation, whereas oxygen radical detoxification via the MrgA-mediated oxidative stress response or KatX catalase activity plays only a very minor role. Synergistic radioprotective effects of α/β-type but not γ-type SASP were also identified, indicating that α/β-type SASP's binding to spore DNA is important in preventing DNA damage due to reactive oxygen species generated by ionizing radiation.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-aem.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5fa1/3911009/0b5d07bb94d9/zam9991049840001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5fa1/3911009/51b8eeff3f9d/zam9991049840002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5fa1/3911009/f68d33126b54/zam9991049840003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/5fa1/3911009/fa460962e9ca/zam9991049840004.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Cultivation of Staphylococcus epidermidis in the human spaceflight environment leads to alterations in the frequency and spectrum of spontaneous rifampicin-resistance mutations in the rpoB gene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4923109/,"Bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus are persistent inhabitants of human spaceflight habitats and represent potential opportunistic pathogens. The effect of the human spaceflight environment on the growth and the frequency of mutations to antibiotic resistance in the model organism Staphylococcus epidermidis strain ATCC12228 was investigated. Six cultures of the test organism were cultivated in biological research in canisters–Petri dish fixation units for 122 h on orbit in the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the SpaceX-3 resupply mission. Asynchronous ground controls (GCs) consisted of identical sets of cultures cultivated for 122 h in the ISS Environmental Simulator at Kennedy Space Center. S. epidermidis exhibited significantly lower viable counts but significantly higher frequencies of mutation to rifampicin (Rif) resistance in space vs. GC cultures. The spectrum of mutations in the rpoB gene leading to Rif R was altered in S. epidermidis isolates cultivated in the ISS compared to GCs. The results suggest that the human spaceflight environment induces unique physiologic stresses on growing bacterial cells leading to changes in mutagenic potential.

Experimental Evolution of Bacillus subtilis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11673879/,"The ongoing rise in global temperatures poses significant challenges to ecosystems, particularly impacting bacterial communities that are central to biogeochemical cycles. The resilience of wild mesophilic bacteria to temperature increases of 2–4 °C remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted experimental evolution on six wild Bacillus strains from two lineages ( Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis ) to examine their thermal adaptation strategies. We exposed the bacteria to gradually increasing temperatures to assess their thermal plasticity, focusing on the genetic mechanisms underlying adaptation. While B. subtilis lineages improved growth at highly critical temperatures, only one increased its thermal niche to 4 °C above their natural range. This finding is concerning given climate change projections. B. cereus strains exhibited higher mutation rates but were not able to grow at increasing temperatures, while B. subtilis required fewer genetic changes to increase heat tolerance, indicating distinct adaptive strategies. We observed convergent evolution in five evolved lines, with mutations in genes involved in c-di-AMP synthesis, which is crucial for potassium transport, implicating this chemical messenger for the first time in heat tolerance. These insights highlight the vulnerability of bacteria to climate change and underscore the importance of genetic background in shaping thermal adaptation.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-biology.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3820/11673879/c6e12cb66ab4/biology-13-01088-g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3820/11673879/1807a3dfffc4/biology-13-01088-g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3820/11673879/a6502068c5b1/biology-13-01088-g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3820/11673879/044d6bd3eb53/biology-13-01088-g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3820/11673879/b2f055c1d255/biology-13-01088-g005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3820/11673879/b62c91b1e7f1/biology-13-01088-g006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3820/11673879/fc805d0c7ece/biology-13-01088-g007.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3820/11673879/1ea637d0e99e/biology-13-01088-g008.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3820/11673879/1b58c014b989/biology-13-01088-g009.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

Alterations in the Spectrum of Spontaneous Rifampicin-Resistance Mutations in the Bacillus subtilis rpoB Gene after Cultivation in the Human Spaceflight Environment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5817088/,"The effect of Bacillus subtilis exposure to the human spaceflight environment on growth, mutagenic frequency, and spectrum of mutations to rifampicin resistance (Rif R ) was investigated. B. subtilis cells were cultivated in Biological Research in Canister-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) on two separate missions to the International Space Station (ISS), dubbed BRIC-18 and BRIC-21, with matching asynchronous ground controls. No statistically significant difference in either growth or in the frequency of mutation to Rif R was found in either experiment. However, nucleotide sequencing of the Rif R regions of the rpoB gene from Rif R mutants revealed dramatic differences in the spectrum of mutations between flight (FL) and ground control (GC) samples, including two newly discovered rpoB alleles in the FL samples (Q137R and L489S). The results strengthen the idea that exposure to the human spaceflight environment causes unique stresses on bacteria, leading to alterations in their mutagenic potential.

Analysis of interactions of Salmonella type three secretion mutants with 3-D intestinal epithelial cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3012082/,"The prevailing paradigm of Salmonella enteropathogenesis based on monolayers asserts that Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 Type Three Secretion System (SPI-1 T3SS) is required for bacterial invasion into intestinal epithelium. However, little is known about the role of SPI-1 in mediating gastrointestinal disease in humans. Recently, SPI-1 deficient nontyphoidal Salmonella strains were isolated from infected humans and animals, indicating that SPI-1 is not required to cause enteropathogenesis and demonstrating the need for more in vivo- like models. Here, we utilized a previously characterized 3-D organotypic model of human intestinal epithelium to elucidate the role of all characterized Salmonella enterica T3SSs. Similar to in vivo reports, the Salmonella SPI-1 T3SS was not required to invade 3-D intestinal cells. Additionally, Salmonella strains carrying single (SPI-1 or SPI-2), double (SPI-1/2) and complete T3SS knockout (SPI-1/SPI-2: flhDC ) also invaded 3-D intestinal cells to wildtype levels. Invasion of wildtype and TTSS mutants was a Salmonella active process, whereas non-invasive bacterial strains, bacterial size beads, and heat-killed Salmonella did not invade 3-D cells. Wildtype and T3SS mutants did not preferentially target different cell types identified within the 3-D intestinal aggregates, including M-cells/M-like cells, enterocytes, or Paneth cells. Moreover, each T3SS was necessary for substantial intracellular bacterial replication within 3-D cells. Collectively, these results indicate that T3SSs are dispensable for Salmonella invasion into highly differentiated 3-D models of human intestinal epithelial cells, but are required for intracellular bacterial growth, paralleling in vivo infection observations and demonstrating the utility of these models in predicting in vivo -like pathogenic mechanisms.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d121/3012082/ff9c3170ff20/pone.0015750.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d121/3012082/98e0a6ab10a3/pone.0015750.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d121/3012082/a0f11b818040/pone.0015750.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d121/3012082/32db81e716be/pone.0015750.g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d121/3012082/36256e96ad95/pone.0015750.g005.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Organotypic 3D cell culture models: using the rotating wall vessel to study host-pathogen interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11088941/,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection occurs in differentiating epithelial tissues, and cancers caused by the high-risk types (e.g., HPV16 and HPV18) typically occur at oropharyngeal and anogenital anatomical sites. The HPV life cycle is differentiation-dependent, requiring tissue culture methodology able to recapitulate the three-dimensional (3D) stratified epithelium. Here we report two distinct and complementary methods to grow differentiating epithelial tissues that mimic many critical morphological and biochemical aspects of in vivo tissue. The first approach involves growing primary human epithelial cells on top of a dermal equivalent consisting of collagen fibers and living fibroblast cells. When these cells are grown at the liquid-air interface, differentiation occurs and allows for epithelial stratification. The second approach uses a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. The low-fluid-shear microgravity environment inside the bioreactor allows the cells to use collagen-coated microbeads as a growth scaffold and self assemble into 3D cellular aggregates. These approaches are applied to epithelial cells derived from HPV-positive and -negative oral and cervical tissues. The second part of the protocol introduces potential downstream applications for these 3D tissue models.
We describe methods that will allow readers to start successfully culturing 3D tissues from oral and cervical cells. These tissues have been used for microscopic visualization, scanning-electron microscopy, and large -omics studies to gain insights into epithelial biology, the HPV life cycle, and host-pathogen interactions.

Induction of attachment-independent biofilm formation and repression of Hfq expression by low-fluid-shear culture of Staphylococcus aureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3187170/,"The opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus encounters a wide variety of fluid shear levels within the human host, and they may play a key role in dictating whether this organism adopts a commensal interaction with the host or transitions to cause disease. By using rotating-wall vessel bioreactors to create a physiologically relevant, low-fluid-shear environment, S. aureus was evaluated for cellular responses that could impact its colonization and virulence. S. aureus cells grown in a low-fluid-shear environment initiated a novel attachment-independent biofilm phenotype and were completely encased in extracellular polymeric substances. Compared to controls, low-shear-cultured cells displayed slower growth and repressed virulence characteristics, including decreased carotenoid production, increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, and reduced survival in whole blood. Transcriptional whole-genome microarray profiling suggested alterations in metabolic pathways. Further genetic expression analysis revealed downregulation of the RNA chaperone Hfq, which parallels low-fluid-shear responses of certain Gram-negative organisms. This is the first study to report an Hfq association with fluid shear in a Gram-positive organism, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved response to fluid shear among structurally diverse prokaryotes. Collectively, our results suggest S. aureus responds to a low-fluid-shear environment by initiating a biofilm/colonization phenotype with diminished virulence characteristics, which could lead to insight into key factors influencing the divergence between infection and colonization during the initial host-pathogen interaction.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-aem.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/44d1/3187170/5fb698e755f2/zam9991025160001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/44d1/3187170/6d1b4c7276d8/zam9991025160002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/44d1/3187170/e5905bbc89a1/zam9991025160003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/44d1/3187170/3b0f2e2b0f5d/zam9991025160004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/44d1/3187170/26ca70f358c1/zam9991025160005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/44d1/3187170/9fa87834b38e/zam9991025160006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/44d1/3187170/e1e26a31edca/zam9991025160007.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Characterization of the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ydcI gene which encodes a conserved DNA binding protein required for full acid stress resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3133089/,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium possesses a stimulon of genes that are differentially regulated in response to conditions of low fluid shear force that increase bacterial virulence and alter other phenotypes. In this study, we show that a previously uncharacterized member of this stimulon, ydcI or STM1625, encodes a highly conserved DNA binding protein with related homologs present in a range of Gram-negative bacterial genera. Gene expression analysis shows that ydcI is expressed in different bacterial genera and is involved in its autoregulation in S . Typhimurium. We demonstrate that purified YdcI protein specifically binds a DNA probe consisting of its own promoter sequence. We constructed an S . Typhimurium Δ ydcI mutant strain and show that this strain is more sensitive to both organic and inorganic acid stress than is an isogenic WT strain, and this defect is complemented in trans . Moreover, our data indicate that ydcI is part of the rpoS regulon related to stress resistance. The S . Typhimurium Δ ydcI mutant was able to invade cultured cells to the same degree as the WT strain, but a strain in which ydcI expression is induced invaded cells at a level 2.8 times higher than that of the WT. In addition, induction of ydcI expression in S . Typhimurium resulted in the formation of a biofilm in stationary-phase cultures. These data indicate the ydcI gene encodes a conserved DNA binding protein involved with aspects of prokaryotic biology related to stress resistance and possibly virulence.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-jbacter.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4f28/3133089/30db04ef310f/zjb9990903310007.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4f28/3133089/1aa51d60ffa1/zjb9990903310001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4f28/3133089/df803180c91b/zjb9990903310002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4f28/3133089/83614b80dfc2/zjb9990903310003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4f28/3133089/974825a64fed/zjb9990903310004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4f28/3133089/4ea86b01c949/zjb9990903310005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4f28/3133089/7dc20039a498/zjb9990903310006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4f28/3133089/0e3498c15cab/zjb9990903310008.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4f28/3133089/a41cf494d88b/zjb9990903310009.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Evaluation of microorganisms cultured from injured and repressed tissue regeneration sites in endangered giant aquatic Ozark Hellbender salamanders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3242767/,"Investigation into the causes underlying the rapid, global amphibian decline provides critical insight into the effects of changing ecosystems. Hypothesized and confirmed links between amphibian declines, disease, and environmental changes are increasingly represented in published literature. However, there are few long-term amphibian studies that include data on population size, abnormality/injury rates, disease, and habitat variables to adequately assess changes through time. We cultured and identified microorganisms isolated from abnormal/injured and repressed tissue regeneration sites of the endangered Ozark Hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi , to discover potential causative agents responsible for their significant decline in health and population. This organism and our study site were chosen because the population and habitat of C. a. bishopi have been intensively studied from 1969–2009, and the abnormality/injury rate and apparent lack of regeneration were established. Although many bacterial and fungal isolates recovered were common environmental organisms, several opportunistic pathogens were identified in association with only the injured tissues of C.a. bishopi . Bacterial isolates included Aeromonas hydrophila , a known amphibian pathogen, Granulicetella adiacens , Gordonai terrae , Stenotrophomonas maltophilia , Aerococcus viridans , Streptococcus pneumoniae and a variety of Pseudomonads, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa , P. stutzeri , and P. alcaligenes . Fungal isolates included species in the genera Penicillium , Acremonium , Cladosporium , Curvularia , Fusarium , Streptomycetes , and the Class Hyphomycetes. Many of the opportunistic pathogens identified are known to form biofilms. Lack of isolation of the same organism from all wounds suggests that the etiological agent responsible for the damage to C. a. bishopi may not be a single organism. To our knowledge, this is the first study to profile the external microbial consortia cultured from a Cryptobranchid salamander. The incidence of abnormalities/injury and retarded regeneration in C. a. bishopi may have many contributing factors including disease and habitat degradation. Results from this study may provide insight into other amphibian population declines.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/abe9/3242767/dfbc749f83db/pone.0028906.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/abe9/3242767/e40db7fa1127/pone.0028906.g002.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Transcriptional and proteomic responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to spaceflight conditions involve Hfq regulation and reveal a role for oxygen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3067220/,"Assessing bacterial behavior in microgravity is important for risk assessment and prevention of infectious diseases during spaceflight missions. Furthermore, this research field allows the unveiling of novel connections between low-fluid-shear regions encountered by pathogens during their natural infection process and bacterial virulence. This study is the first to characterize the spaceflight-induced global transcriptional and proteomic responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , an opportunistic pathogen that is present in the space habitat. P. aeruginosa responded to spaceflight conditions through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins, with Hfq as a global transcriptional regulator. Since Hfq was also differentially regulated in spaceflight-grown Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Hfq represents the first spaceflight-induced regulator acting across bacterial species. The major P. aeruginosa virulence-related genes induced in spaceflight were the lecA and lecB lectin genes and the gene for rhamnosyltransferase ( rhlA ), which is involved in rhamnolipid production. The transcriptional response of spaceflight-grown P. aeruginosa was compared with our previous data for this organism grown in microgravity analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. Interesting similarities were observed, including, among others, similarities with regard to Hfq regulation and oxygen metabolism. While RWV-grown P. aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved in microaerophilic metabolism, P. aeruginosa cultured in spaceflight presumably adopted an anaerobic mode of growth, in which denitrification was most prominent. Whether the observed changes in pathogenesis-related gene expression in response to spaceflight culture could lead to an alteration of virulence in P. aeruginosa remains to be determined and will be important for infectious disease risk assessment and prevention, both during spaceflight missions and for the general public.
The microgravity environment associated with spaceflight is unique and has a profound effect on both host and pathogen cells, with potential implications for infectious disease. From the host point of view, astronauts experience a compromised immune response under spaceflight conditions, as reflected in cellular alterations of both the innate and adaptive immune systems ( 23 , 26 , 40 ). Spaceflight has been shown to alter the response of monocytes, isolated from astronauts preflight and in flight, to Gram-negative toxins ( 27 ). Further, simulation of aspects of this microgravity-associated decreased immune response, using the hind limb unloaded mouse model, showed an enhanced susceptibility of these animals to bacterial infection ( 3 , 6 ). From the pathogen's perspective, bacterial obligate and opportunistic pathogens have been found to exhibit enhanced stress resistance phenotypes following growth under both true spaceflight and microgravity analogue conditions ( 13 , 30 , 33 , 46 - 49 ). In response to the spaceflight environment, global transcriptional and proteomic changes were observed for the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium grown in the complex medium Lennox L broth base (LB), which were associated with an increased virulence in a murine model of infection ( 46 ). Moreover, the small RNA binding protein Hfq was identified as a major transcriptional regulator of S. Typhimurium responses to the spaceflight environment. A subsequent study demonstrated that cultivation of S. Typhimurium in M9 minimal medium abolished the spaceflight-induced virulence ( 47 ). While M9 spaceflight cultures of S. Typhimurium exhibited virulence characteristics dramatically different from those in LB, microarray and proteomic analyses revealed a role for Hfq in both the M9 and LB spaceflight stimulons ( 47 ). Complementary experiments using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, in which cells are cultured in a microgravity analogue low-fluid-shear environment (i.e., low-shear modeled microgravity [LSMMG]), identified that a low phosphate concentration in LB could be the origin of the spaceflight-induced virulence of S. Typhimurium ( 47 ). Interestingly, LSMMG and spaceflight induced similar increased virulence when LB medium was used, and overlapping gene expression profiles, including Hfq and members of the Hfq regulon, were obtained for both growth conditions ( 47 ). The latter indicates that molecular and phenotypic similarities between LSMMG and spaceflight conditions could be attributed to the analogous low-fluid-shear environment.
Recently, the global transcriptional response of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to LSMMG was determined ( 13 ). As a ubiquitous organism colonizing both environmental niches and the human body, P. aeruginosa is found in spacecrafts and has previously caused infections in astronauts ( 8 , 24 , 35 , 43 ). Cultivation of P. aeruginosa in the LSMMG environment of the RWV induced molecular pathways known to be of importance for virulence, compared to control conditions. In agreement with the microarray data, an increased production of the exopolysaccharide alginate, enhanced resistance to heat and oxidative stress, and a decreased oxygen transfer rate were observed. The alternative sigma factor AlgU and Hfq were both proposed as important mediators of the LSMMG response in P. aeruginosa . In addition, by comparing the behavior of P. aeruginosa cultured in LSMMG to that in a higher-fluid-shear control at body temperature, clinically relevant traits were found to be induced, such as biofilm formation, rhamnolipid production, and the C 4 -homoserine lactone quorum sensing system ( 12 ). Collectively, these data indicate that low fluid shear has an impact on the behavior, and possibly on the pathogenicity, of P. aeruginosa .
Importantly, low-fluid-shear zones are believed to be encountered by pathogens during their natural course of infection in vivo , including in the intestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts ( 12 , 34 ). Therefore, in addition to the importance of spaceflight research for the evaluation of infectious disease risk during long-term missions, this research field has the potential to provide novel insights in the role of fluid shear in virulence and the disease process.
This study describes the global transcriptional and translational responses of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to the microgravity environment of spaceflight. Our aim was to assess whether the microgravity environment of spaceflight could induce virulence traits in P. aeruginosa and if evolutionarily conserved pathways in common with those of spaceflight-grown S. Typhimurium were regulated in a similar fashion. Furthermore, the spaceflight (this study) and LSMMG ( 13 ) responses of P. aeruginosa were compared and revealed interesting similarities. In addition to the role of low fluid shear in these observations, the possible involvement of the adopted experimental setup is discussed. The present study is the first to assess the molecular response of an important opportunistic pathogen following growth under actual spaceflight conditions and provides important insights into the evaluation and, eventually, the prevention of P. aeruginosa infections during spaceflight missions.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-aem.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d3cf/3067220/78cf551e64b2/zam9991017800001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d3cf/3067220/ded9b0503a57/zam9991017800003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d3cf/3067220/4f7665da1084/zam9991017800002.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
New insights into the bacterial fitness-associated mechanisms revealed by the characterization of large plasmids of an avian pathogenic E. coli,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3251573/,"Extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), including avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC), pose a considerable threat to both human and animal health, with illness causing substantial economic loss. APEC strain χ7122 (O78∶K80∶H9), containing three large plasmids [pChi7122-1 (IncFIB/FIIA-FIC), pChi7122-2 (IncFII), and pChi7122-3 (IncI 2 )]; and a small plasmid pChi7122-4 (ColE2-like), has been used for many years as a model strain to study the molecular mechanisms of ExPEC pathogenicity and zoonotic potential. We previously sequenced and characterized the plasmid pChi7122-1 and determined its importance in systemic APEC infection; however the roles of the other pChi7122 plasmids were still ambiguous. Herein we present the sequence of the remaining pChi7122 plasmids, confirming that pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 encode an ABC iron transport system ( eitABCD ) and a putative type IV fimbriae respectively, whereas pChi7122-4 is a cryptic plasmid. New features were also identified, including a gene cluster on pChi7122-2 that is not present in other E. coli strains but is found in Salmonella serovars and is predicted to encode the sugars catabolic pathways. In vitro evaluation of the APEC χ7122 derivative strains with the three large plasmids, either individually or in combinations, provided new insights into the role of plasmids in biofilm formation, bile and acid tolerance, and the interaction of E. coli strains with 3-D cultures of intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, we show that the nature and combinations of plasmids, as well as the background of the host strains, have an effect on these phenomena. Our data reveal new insights into the role of extra-chromosomal sequences in fitness and diversity of ExPEC in their phenotypes.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1062/3251573/7f743d4fcf93/pone.0029481.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1062/3251573/c795a8775a9d/pone.0029481.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1062/3251573/e26382778a33/pone.0029481.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1062/3251573/018fc9a8cf66/pone.0029481.g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1062/3251573/43a51bb6aede/pone.0029481.g005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1062/3251573/04c609800dd5/pone.0029481.g006.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Lack of norovirus replication and histo-blood group antigen expression in 3-dimensional intestinal epithelial cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3647661/,"Noroviruses (NoVs) are a leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. An in vitro model for NoV replication remains elusive, making study of the virus difficult. A previous study, which used a 3-dimensional (3-D) intestinal model derived from INT-407 cells reported NoV replication and extensive cytopathic effects (CPE). Using the same 3-D model, but with highly purified Norwalk virus (NV), we attempted to replicate this study. Our results showed no evidence of NV replication by real-time PCR of viral RNA or by immunocytochemical detection of viral structural and nonstructural proteins. Immunocytochemical analysis of the 3-D cultures also showed no detectable presence of histo-blood group antigens that participate in NV binding and host tropism. To determine the potential cause of CPE observed in the previous study, we exposed 3-D cultures to lipopolysaccharide concentrations consistent with contaminated stool samples and observed morphologic features similar to CPE. We conclude that the 3-D INT-407 model does not support NV replication.
Norovirus (NoV) has been identified as the primary etiologic agent of acute epidemic viral gastroenteritis in industrialized countries ( 1 , 2 ). Norwalk virus (NV) is the human prototype GI.1 NoV strain; it belongs to the Caliciviridae family of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA, nonenveloped viruses ( 3 ). Human-to-human transmission of NoV occurs primarily through the fecal-oral route, with the small intestine being the initial site of viral replication ( 1 , 4 ). The lack of an efficient cell culture system in which to study NoV infections has hindered development of antiviral drugs to control or limit NoV outbreaks ( 5 ).
Currently, animal models are being used to increase our understanding of NoV infections ( 6 – 12 ); however, no small animal model for NoV mimics the disease manifestations observed in humans ( 7 , 11 – 13 ). As a result, human outbreaks and volunteer studies have been the primary source for existing knowledge of NV epidemiology and pathogenesis, respectively ( 1 , 14 , 15 ). A major finding from human NV volunteer studies is that persons with strains containing 2 mutated alleles of the α(1,2) fucosyltransferase ( FUT2 ) gene were resistant to NV infection ( 16 – 20 ). FUT2 encodes an enzyme that produces histo-blood group antigens (HBGA) on the surface of epithelial cells and in mucosal secretions ( 21 , 22 ). Persons who lack a functional FUT2 gene cannot generate ABH antigens in secretions and, thus, are termed nonsecretors ( 23 , 24 ). HBGA are complex carbohydrates distinguished by different monosaccharides added to a precursor oligosaccharide by fucosyltransferase enzymes ( 2 3, 24 ). In the human gastroduodenal junction where NV has been shown to bind HBGA type 1 (Lewis b [Le b ]), is found exclusively on epithelial surfaces, whereas HBGA type 2 is primarily found at the glandular level ( 19 , 24 – 26 ). In vitro experiments using NV virus-like particles (VLPs) directly showed NV VLP attachment to HBGA, resulting in VLP internalization into the cell ( 19 ). In addition, NV VLPs were found to preferentially bind to A and H type 1 and Le b carbohydrates ( 19 , 27 – 29 ). From these critical studies, putative NV receptors were identified, and thus it was hypothesized that a successful in vitro cell culture system would most likely possess these receptors to support NV replication.
Although most of the understanding of NoV infections in humans has been derived from volunteer studies and authentic sporadic outbreaks, extensive volunteer studies have limitations (variability, cost, and institutional review board considerations). As a result, many attempts have been made to develop a reproducible in vitro model system to culture NoV, but none has yet proved successful ( 13 , 30 – 33 ). However, one publication has reported establishing a productive NoV infection in a 3-dimensional (3-D) organotypic model of human intestinal epithelium derived from the human embryonic intestinal epithelial cell line INT-407 ( 30 ). We report here an unsuccessful attempt to replicate these findings using NV.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-eid.gif"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d352/3647661/cba0e8783882/12-1029-F1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d352/3647661/d54c6e06b66d/12-1029-F2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d352/3647661/5a1938e3246a/12-1029-F3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d352/3647661/a2f18edd000d/12-1029-F4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/d352/3647661/942f2188c0df/12-1029-F5.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Conservation of the low-shear modeled microgravity response in Enterobacteriaceae and analysis of the trp genes in this response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4085587/,"Low fluid shear force, including that encountered in microgravity models, induces bacterial responses, but the range of bacteria capable of responding to this signal remains poorly characterized. We systematically analyzed a range of Gram negative Enterobacteriaceae for conservation of the low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) response using phenotypic assays, qPCR, and targeted mutations. Our results indicate LSMMG response conservation across Enterobacteriacae with potential variance in up- or down-regulation of a given response depending on genus. Based on the data, we analyzed the role of the trp operon genes and the TrpR regulator in the LSMMG response using targeted mutations in these genes in S. Typhimurium and E. coli . We found no alteration of the LSMMG response compared to WT in these mutant strains under the conditions tested here. To our knowledge, this study is first-of-kind for Citrobacter, Enterobacter , and Serratia, presents novel data for Escherichia , and provides the first analysis of trp genes in LSMMG responses. This impacts our understanding of how LSMMG affects bacteria and our ability to modify bacteria with this condition in the future.

Mimicking the host and its microenvironment in vitro for studying mucosal infections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4096993/,"Why is a healthy person protected from Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, while individuals with cystic fibrosis or damaged epithelium are particularly susceptible to this opportunistic pathogen? In order to address this question, it is essential to thoroughly understand the dynamic interplay between the host microenvironment and P. aeruginosa . Therefore, using modeI systems that represent key aspects of human mucosal tissues in health and disease allows recreating in vivo host-pathogen interactions in a physiologically relevant manner. In this review, we discuss how factors of mucosal tissues, such as apical-basolateral polarity, junctional complexes, extracellular matrix proteins, mucus, multicellular complexity (including indigenous microbiota), and other physicochemical factors affect P. aeruginosa pathogenesis and are thus important to mimic in vitro . We highlight in vitro cell and tissue culture model systems of increasing complexity that have been used over the past 35 years to study the infectious disease process of P. aeruginosa , mainly focusing on lung models, and their respective advantages and limitations. Continued improvements of in vitro models based on our expanding knowledge of host microenvironmental factors that participate in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis will help advance fundamental understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and increase the translational potential of research findings from bench to the patient’s bedside.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-nihpa.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/72ba/4096993/ba4e0783df65/nihms586687f1.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Effects of Sex and Gender on Adaptation to Space: Immune System,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7467030/,"To address urgent need for strategies to limit mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), this review describes experimental, clinical and epidemiological evidence that suggests that chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks before infection might increase risk of COVID-19 mortality in multiple ways. Sub-optimal hydration is associated with key risk factors for COVID-19 mortality, including older age, male sex, race-ethnicity and chronic disease. Chronic hypertonicity, total body water deficit and/or hypovolemia cause multiple intracellular and/or physiologic adaptations that preferentially retain body water and favor positive total body water balance when challenged by infection. Via effects on serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) signaling, aldosterone, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), aquaporin 5 (AQP5) and/or Na + /K + -ATPase, chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks before exposure to COVID-19 may conceivably result in: greater abundance of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the lung, which increases likelihood of COVID-19 infection, lung epithelial cells which are pre-set for exaggerated immune response, increased capacity for capillary leakage of fluid into the airway space, and/or reduced capacity for both passive and active transport of fluid out of the airways. The hypothesized hydration effects suggest hypotheses regarding strategies for COVID-19 risk reduction, such as public health recommendations to increase intake of drinking water, hydration screening alongside COVID-19 testing, and treatment tailored to the pre-infection hydration condition. Hydration may link risk factors and pathways in a unified mechanism for COVID-19 mortality. Attention to hydration holds potential to reduce COVID-19 mortality and disparities via at least 5 pathways simultaneously.

Recellularization of decellularized lung scaffolds is enhanced by dynamic suspension culture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4427280/,"Strategies are needed to improve repopulation of decellularized lung scaffolds with stromal and functional epithelial cells. We demonstrate that decellularized mouse lungs recellularized in a dynamic low fluid shear suspension bioreactor, termed the rotating wall vessel (RWV), contained more cells with decreased apoptosis, increased proliferation and enhanced levels of total RNA compared to static recellularization conditions. These results were observed with two relevant mouse cell types: bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) and alveolar type II cells (C10). In addition, MSCs cultured in decellularized lungs under static but not bioreactor conditions formed multilayered aggregates. Gene expression and immunohistochemical analyses suggested differentiation of MSCs into collagen I-producing fibroblast-like cells in the bioreactor, indicating enhanced potential for remodeling of the decellularized scaffold matrix. In conclusion, dynamic suspension culture is promising for enhancing repopulation of decellularized lungs, and could contribute to remodeling the extracellular matrix of the scaffolds with subsequent effects on differentiation and functionality of inoculated cells.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/81cd/4427280/034a4183d597/pone.0126846.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/81cd/4427280/c131cf7dc554/pone.0126846.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/81cd/4427280/4c745317ed6f/pone.0126846.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/81cd/4427280/6015f87bfc2c/pone.0126846.g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/81cd/4427280/1b8ddd96e6fd/pone.0126846.g005.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Three-dimensional organotypic co-culture model of intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages to study Salmonella enterica colonization patterns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5460263/,"Three-dimensional models of human intestinal epithelium mimic the differentiated form and function of parental tissues often not exhibited by two-dimensional monolayers and respond to Salmonella in key ways that reflect in vivo infections. To further enhance the physiological relevance of three-dimensional models to more closely approximate in vivo intestinal microenvironments encountered by Salmonella , we developed and validated a novel three-dimensional co-culture infection model of colonic epithelial cells and macrophages using the NASA Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactor. First, U937 cells were activated upon collagen-coated scaffolds. HT-29 epithelial cells were then added and the three-dimensional model was cultured in the bioreactor until optimal differentiation was reached, as assessed by immunohistochemical profiling and bead uptake assays. The new co-culture model exhibited in vivo-like structural and phenotypic characteristics, including three-dimensional architecture, apical-basolateral polarity, well-formed tight/adherens junctions, mucin, multiple epithelial cell types, and functional macrophages. Phagocytic activity of macrophages was confirmed by uptake of inert, bacteria-sized beads. Contribution of macrophages to infection was assessed by colonization studies of Salmonella pathovars with different host adaptations and disease phenotypes (Typhimurium ST19 strain SL1344 and ST313 strain D23580 ; Typhi Ty2). ﻿﻿In addition, Salmonella were cultured aerobically or microaerobically, recapitulating environments encountered prior to and during intestinal infection, respectively﻿. All Salmonella strains exhibited decreased colonization in co-culture (HT-29-U937) relative to epithelial (HT-29) models, indicating antimicrobial function of macrophages. Interestingly, D23580 exhibited enhanced replication/survival in both models following invasion. Pathovar-specific differences in colonization and intracellular co-localization patterns were observed. These findings emphasize the power of incorporating a series of related three-dimensional models within a study to identify microenvironmental factors important for regulating infection.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-npjmicrogr.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3af2/5460263/53aaca17235c/41526_2017_11_Fig1_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3af2/5460263/7fb5cded3dd7/41526_2017_11_Fig2_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3af2/5460263/ce56ee492d4d/41526_2017_11_Fig3_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3af2/5460263/26119899a3f8/41526_2017_11_Fig4_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3af2/5460263/9f2df0789e82/41526_2017_11_Fig5_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3af2/5460263/e0a1f7c1e34b/41526_2017_11_Fig6_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3af2/5460263/8cf4727077a5/41526_2017_11_Fig8_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/3af2/5460263/45b260cbfabf/41526_2017_11_Fig7_HTML.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

Evaluating the effect of spaceflight on the host‚Äìpathogen interaction between human intestinal epithelial cells and Salmonella Typhimurium,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7943786/,"Spaceflight uniquely alters the physiology of both human cells and microbial pathogens, stimulating cellular and molecular changes directly relevant to infectious disease. However, the influence of this environment on host–pathogen interactions remains poorly understood. Here we report our results from the STL-IMMUNE study flown aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-131, which investigated multi-omic responses (transcriptomic, proteomic) of human intestinal epithelial cells to infection with Salmonella Typhimurium when both host and pathogen were simultaneously exposed to spaceflight. To our knowledge, this was the first in-flight infection and dual RNA-seq analysis using human cells.

While pre-flight screening and quarantine procedures have reduced infection incidence, astronauts and cargo can still harbor opportunistic and obligate pathogens, including Salmonella spp., which have been recovered from both crew refuse and International Space Station (ISS) surfaces 5 – 8 . We previously discovered that spaceflight and spaceflight analog culture increased the virulence and stress resistance of the foodborne pathogen, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( Salmonella ) 9 – 12 . These environments have also been shown to increase the virulence and/or alter pathogenesis-related phenotypes of other microorganisms 13 – 16 . Collectively, these findings indicate an increased risk for infection during space travel and underscore the need for a more in-depth understanding of the similarities and differences between spaceflight and ground-based infection mechanisms.
Studies performed in spaceflight and spaceflight analog environments have revealed unexpected physiological responses in both mammalian and microbial cells 14 , 15 . This is not surprising given that physical forces in the cellular microenvironment (including those associated with microgravity) profoundly alter both host and pathogen phenotypes through mechanotransduction 17 . An integrated network involving the cytoskeleton, cell surface receptors, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) mediates the dynamic three-dimensional (3D) interactions between host cells and their external environment to regulate cellular responses 17 – 19 . Since spaceflight alters the organization and/or expression of these classes of proteins 14 , 20 , 21 , it is logical to predict that this environment could impact infection processes for invasive pathogens like Salmonella that hijack the host and actively exploit these structural networks to enable their invasion and dissemination 22 , 23 .
From the pathogen perspective, we previously discovered that spaceflight analog culture of Salmonella in the Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactor led to increased virulence in mice 24 , enhanced stress resistance 9 – 11 , 24 , global transcriptional and proteomic reprogramming 11 , 12 , 24 and enhanced the colonization of a human 3D intestinal co-culture model (JB, SY, RRD, RJF, CMO, JS, CAN; manuscript in preparation). Space Shuttle experiments aboard STS-115 and STS-123 independently confirmed RWV trends by demonstrating that spaceflight increased the virulence and globally altered the transcriptomic and proteomic responses of Salmonella relative to identical ground controls 9 , 10 . Supplementation of select ions in the media was able to counteract this spaceflight-associated increased virulence 10 . It is important to note that Salmonella virulence studies were performed when the bacteria were cultured in spaceflight, brought back to Earth and immediately used in animal infections (i.e., the host was not exposed to spaceflight). Transcriptional profiling revealed a central role for the RNA-binding protein Hfq in the response of Salmonella to both spaceflight and spaceflight analog culture in the RWV 9 , 10 and subsequent studies indicated altered expression of hfq or the Hfq regulon in other microbes 25 – 28 .
In this study, we investigated how spaceflight culture alters the response of human intestinal epithelial cells (HT-29) to infection by Salmonella when both the host and pathogen were exposed to spaceflight. The experiment was flown as part of the Space Tissue Loss (STL) payload and operationally designated as STL-IMMUNE, since epithelial cells are excellent sentinels of innate immunity by providing the first physical and chemical barriers to infection and coordinating additional innate and mucosal defenses and subsequent adaptive responses 29 , 30 . Since in-flight technical limitations precluded the use of gentamicin protection assays to quantify bacterial invasion into the epithelium, we focused our analysis on transcriptomic (dual RNA-seq of host and pathogen) and proteomic profiling (Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification/iTRAQ). These global analyses can yield valuable insight into the status of healthy and infected cells. Figure 1 shows the experimental design and timeline for STL-IMMUNE and schematic of hollow fiber bioreactors used for 3D cell culture. HT-29 cells were seeded into the extracapillary space (ECS) of hollow fiber bioreactors which contained collagen I-coated capillary fibers for intestinal cell attachment. Oxygenated and CO 2 -containing media was continually perfused through the intracapillary space (ICS) of the fibers (underneath the basal side of the cells, which also prevented exposure of cells to high fluid shear forces). During spaceflight, Salmonella was introduced to the apical side of HT-29 cultures through ECS ports and allowed to incubate for 6 h before fixative was perfused through the ICS.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-npjmicrogr.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bcd1/7943786/4f0761fd4652/41526_2021_136_Fig1_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bcd1/7943786/262527db19d2/41526_2021_136_Fig2_HTML.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Rapid phenotypic response of LSMMG-'primed' Candida albicans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11888247/,"Candida albicans is a commensal yeast that is a common component of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome of humans. C. albicans has been shown to bloom in the GI tract of individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and can promote and increase the severity of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). However, the effects of C. albicans blooms on the host in the context of AUD or AUD-related phenotypes, such as ethanol preference, have been unstudied. In this work, we report a reduction in ethanol consumption and preference in mice colonized with C. albicans . C. albicans -colonized mice exhibited elevated levels of serum PGE 2 and reduced ethanol preference was reversed by injection with antagonists of PGE 2 receptors. Further, injection of mice with a PGE 2 derivative decreased their ethanol preference. These results show that PGE 2 acting on its receptors EP1 and EP2 drives reduced ethanol preference in C. albicans -colonized mice. We also showed altered transcription of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum of C. albicans -colonized mice and more rapid acquisition of ethanol conditioned taste aversion, suggesting alterations to reinforcement or aversion learning. Finally, C. albicans -colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol-induced motor coordination impairment showing significant alterations to the behavioral effects of ethanol. This study identifies a member of the fungal microbiome that alters ethanol preference and demonstrates a role for PGE 2 signaling in these phenotypes.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-preprints.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7387/11888247/e7fa4bc0bebb/nihpp-2025.02.25.640044v1-f0001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7387/11888247/c4b9c780af99/nihpp-2025.02.25.640044v1-f0002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7387/11888247/c4e368d25296/nihpp-2025.02.25.640044v1-f0003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7387/11888247/4cbaecaf2236/nihpp-2025.02.25.640044v1-f0004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7387/11888247/386bed3bbb44/nihpp-2025.02.25.640044v1-f0005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7387/11888247/99f39ca2bb62/nihpp-2025.02.25.640044v1-f0006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7387/11888247/5254b22523c0/nihpp-2025.02.25.640044v1-f0007.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7387/11888247/88618d8a3a97/nihpp-2025.02.25.640044v1-f0008.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Spaceflight enhances cell aggregation and random budding in Candida albicans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3851762/,"This study presents the first global transcriptional profiling and phenotypic characterization of the major human opportunistic fungal pathogen, Candida albicans , grown in spaceflight conditions. Microarray analysis revealed that C. albicans subjected to short-term spaceflight culture differentially regulated 452 genes compared to synchronous ground controls, which represented 8.3% of the analyzed ORFs. Spaceflight-cultured C. albicans –induced genes involved in cell aggregation (similar to flocculation), which was validated by microscopic and flow cytometry analysis. We also observed enhanced random budding of spaceflight-cultured cells as opposed to bipolar budding patterns for ground samples, in accordance with the gene expression data. Furthermore, genes involved in antifungal agent and stress resistance were differentially regulated in spaceflight, including induction of ABC transporters and members of the major facilitator family, downregulation of ergosterol-encoding genes, and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. Finally, downregulation of genes involved in actin cytoskeleton was observed. Interestingly, the transcriptional regulator Cap1 and over 30% of the Cap1 regulon was differentially expressed in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans . A potential role for Cap1 in the spaceflight response of C. albicans is suggested, as this regulator is involved in random budding, cell aggregation, and oxidative stress resistance; all related to observed spaceflight-associated changes of C. albicans . While culture of C. albicans in microgravity potentiates a global change in gene expression that could induce a virulence-related phenotype, no increased virulence in a murine intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was observed under the conditions of this study. Collectively, our data represent an important basis for the assessment of the risk that commensal flora could play during human spaceflight missions. Furthermore, since the low fluid-shear environment of microgravity is relevant to physical forces encountered by pathogens during the infection process, insights gained from this study could identify novel infectious disease mechanisms, with downstream benefits for the general public.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7f95/3851762/bb3cd0b2947b/pone.0080677.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7f95/3851762/479dd3161c80/pone.0080677.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7f95/3851762/9aac4e78f6eb/pone.0080677.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7f95/3851762/2193df6e3e3b/pone.0080677.g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7f95/3851762/45212e87531b/pone.0080677.g005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7f95/3851762/2ca7fa94d95c/pone.0080677.g006.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
"Growth and antifungal resistance of the pathogenic yeast, Candida albicans, in the microgravity environment of the International Space Station: An aggregate of multiple flight experiences.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8067245/,"This report was designed to compare spaceflight-induced cellular and physiological adaptations of Candida albicans cultured in microgravity on the International Space Station across several payloads. C. albicans is a common opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for a variety of superficial infections as well as systemic and more severe infections in humans. Cumulatively, the propensity of this organism to be widespread through the population, the ability to produce disease in immunocompromised individuals, and the tendency to respond to environmental stress with characteristics associated with increased virulence, require a better understanding of the yeast response to microgravity for spaceflight crew safety. As such, the responses of this yeast cultivated during several missions using two in-flight culture bioreactors were analyzed and compared herein. In general, C. albicans had a slightly shorter generation time and higher growth propensity in microgravity as compared to terrestrial controls. Rates of cell filamentation differed between bioreactors, but were low and not significantly different between flight and terrestrial controls. Viable cells were retrieved and cultured, resulting in a colony morphology that was similar between cells cultivated in flight and in terrestrial control conditions, and in contrast to that previously observed in a ground-based microgravity analog system. Of importance, yeast demonstrated an increased resistance when challenged during spaceflight with the antifungal agent, amphotericin B. Similar levels of resistance were not observed when challenged with the functionally disparate antifungal drug caspofungin. In aggregate, yeast cells cultivated in microgravity demonstrated a subset of characteristics associated with virulence. In addition, and beyond the value of the specific responses of C. albicans to microgravity, this report includes an analysis of biological reproducibility across flight opportunities, compares two spaceflight hardware systems, and includes a summary of general flight and payload timelines.

Direct RNA sequencing of astronaut blood reveals spaceflight-associated m6A increases and hematopoietic transcriptional responses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166648/,"The advent of civilian spaceflight challenges scientists to precisely describe the effects of spaceflight on human physiology, particularly at the molecular and cellular level. Newer, nanopore-based sequencing technologies can quantitatively map changes in chemical structure and expression at single molecule resolution across entire isoforms. We perform long-read, direct RNA nanopore sequencing, as well as Ultima high-coverage RNA-sequencing, of whole blood sampled longitudinally from four SpaceX Inspiration4 astronauts at seven timepoints, spanning pre-flight, day of return, and post-flight recovery. We report key genetic pathways, including changes in erythrocyte regulation, stress induction, and immune changes affected by spaceflight. We also present the first m 6 A methylation profiles for a human space mission, suggesting a significant spike in m 6 A levels immediately post-flight.

Microfluidics-enabled method to identify modes of Caenorhabditis elegans paralysis in four anthelmintics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3838407/,"The discovery of new drugs is often propelled by the increasing resistance of parasites to existing drugs and the availability of better technology platforms. The area of microfluidics has provided devices for faster screening of compounds, controlled sampling/sorting of whole animals, and automated behavioral pattern recognition. In most microfluidic devices, drug effects on small animals (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans ) are quantified by an end-point, dose response curve representing a single parameter (such as worm velocity or stroke frequency). Here, we present a multi-parameter extraction method to characterize modes of paralysis in C. elegans over an extended time period. A microfluidic device with real-time imaging is used to expose C. elegans to four anthelmintic drugs (i.e., pyrantel, levamisole, tribendimidine, and methyridine). We quantified worm behavior with parameters such as curls per second, types of paralyzation, mode frequency, and number/duration of active/immobilization periods. Each drug was chosen at EC 75 where 75% of the worm population is responsive to the drug. At equipotent concentrations, we observed differences in the manner with which worms paralyzed in drug environments. Our study highlights the need for assaying drug effects on small animal models with multiple parameters quantified at regular time points over an extended period to adequately capture the resistance and adaptability in chemical environments.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-biomicrofluid.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/44b4/3838407/5f4f8d36d275/BIOMGB-000007-064103_1-g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/44b4/3838407/69746f7263c9/BIOMGB-000007-064103_1-g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/44b4/3838407/86c7554366f1/BIOMGB-000007-064103_1-g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/44b4/3838407/118a39b9c5df/BIOMGB-000007-064103_1-g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/44b4/3838407/f3c5700dfd74/BIOMGB-000007-064103_1-g005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/44b4/3838407/5c02f04f691d/BIOMGB-000007-064103_1-g006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/44b4/3838407/83673ac26fc0/BIOMGB-000007-064103_1-g007.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Multiparameter behavioral analyses provide insights to mechanisms of cyanide resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3748764/,"Environmental toxicants influence development, behavior, and ultimately survival. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has proven to be an exceptionally powerful model for toxicological studies. Here, we develop novel technologies to describe the effects of cyanide toxicity with high spatiotemporal resolution. Importantly, we use these methods to examine the genetic underpinnings of cyanide resistance. Caenorhabditis elegans that lack the EGL-9 oxygen sensing enzyme have been shown to be resistant to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas produced by the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. We demonstrate that the cyanide resistance exhibited by egl-9 mutants is completely dependent on the HIF-1 hypoxia-inducible factor and is mediated by the cysl-2 cysteine synthase, which likely functions in metabolic pathways that inactivate cyanide. Further, the expression of cysl-2 correlates with the degree of cyanide resistance exhibited in each genetic background. We find that each mutant exhibits similar relative resistance to HCN gas on plates or to aqueous potassium cyanide in microfluidic chambers. The design of the microfluidic devices, in combination with real-time imaging, addresses a series of challenges presented by mutant phenotypes and by the chemical nature of the toxicant. The microfluidic assay produces a set of behavioral parameters with increased resolution that describe cyanide toxicity and resistance in C. elegans , and this is particularly useful in analyzing subtle phenotypes. These multiparameter analyses of C. elegans behavior hold great potential as a means to monitor the effects of toxicants or chemical interventions in real time and to study the biological networks that underpin toxicant resistance.
Key Words: Caenorhabditis elegans , microfluidics, hypoxia-inducible factor, cyanide toxicity, transcription factor.
The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has proven to be an excellent model for studying the mechanisms by which animals respond to environmental signals or toxicants ( Albrecht and Bargmann, 2011 ; Leung et al. , 2008 ; Zuryn et al. , 2008 ). Advantages include a fully sequenced genome, genetic tractability, extensive knowledge of its development and anatomy, and ease of culture ( Brenner, 1974 ). Behavioral analyses of C. elegans can be employed to assess fast-acting toxicants or pharmacological treatments that cause uncoordinated movement or paralysis. The combination of genetics and in-depth analyses of toxicant effects provides important insights to the mechanisms by which toxicants or pollutants impair animal function.
There are technical challenges to assaying the effects of fast-acting aqueous toxicants. In the laboratory, C. elegans are usually cultured on agarose plates with bacterial food. If placed in a liquid droplet, the animals thrash and are difficult to image. Microfluidic devices resolve this by maintaining the animals in a single plane of focus, but animals often seek to escape chambers containing poisonous substances. To overcome these obstacles, we designed a chamber that allows mechanical insertion of individuals. We also engineered a custom port design that permits worm entry but prevents exit. Additional design modifications enable real-time imaging and chemical testing with applications for mutants that behave unpredictably in the presence of electric fields, agarose gel, or toxicants.
Among the toxicants in our environment, cyanide is an especially potent poison ( Beasley and Glass, 1998 ; Budde and Roth, 2011 ; Gallagher and Manoil, 2001 ). It is produced as a by-product of many industrial processes, chemical reactions, and even fires ( Hamel, 2011 ). Cyanide exerts its toxic effects by irreversibly binding to iron, thereby incapacitating proteins required for aerobic respiration. This prevents normal oxygen utilization and decreases ATP production ultimately causing cellular asphyxiation and death ( Beasley and Glass, 1998 ). Several bacteria, including the nearly ubiquitous human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa , produce cyanide ( Blumer and Haas, 2000 ), and this is especially devastating to patients with compromised respiratory or immune systems.
Caenorhabditis elegans lacking a functional egl-9 gene have been shown to be resistant to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas produced by the pathogen P. aeruginosa PAO1 ( Darby et al. , 1999 ; Gallagher and Manoil, 2001 ; Shao et al. , 2010 ). This is especially intriguing because the EGL-9 protein functions as a cellular oxygen sensor. EGL-9 hydroxylates the HIF-1 hypoxia-inducible factor using oxygen as a cosubstrate, and this modification targets HIF-1 for degradation ( Epstein et al. , 2001 ). The HIF-1 transcription factor controls changes in gene expression that allow animals to adapt to oxygen deprivation ( Jiang et al. , 2001 ; Shen et al. , 2005 ). Loss-of-function mutations in the C. elegans egl-9 gene cause HIF-1 to be expressed at high levels and to be overactive ( Bishop et al. , 2004 ; Epstein et al. , 2001 ; Shen et al. , 2006 ). This, in turn, affects C. elegans development, stress response, longevity, and behavior ( Powell-Coffman, 2010 ). How does a loss-of-function mutation in egl-9 and the accompanying overactivation of HIF-1 protect C. elegans from cyanide toxicity? To address this question, we examined the roles of egl-9 , hif-1 , and the cysl-2 cysteine synthase gene in cyanide resistance, employing both HCN gas assays and real-time imaging in a custom microfluidic device to describe multiple parameters of these behavioral phenotypes. These experiments confirmed that mutations that confer resistance to the paralyzing effects of HCN gas also protect C. elegans from potassium cyanide (KCN) in the microfluidic chambers, and they illuminate the mechanisms that protect egl-9 mutant worms from cyanide toxicity. Finally, we further explored and verified the broader applicability of our microfluidic device, using the anthelminthic drug levamisole. The combination of microfluidics and automated imaging increases the power of C. elegans as a genetic model system to study the effects of toxicants or chemical interventions in real time.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-toxsci.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a7a7/3748764/3b5b6e37e8a7/toxsci_kft138_f0002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a7a7/3748764/1bef6c48c347/toxsci_kft138_f0001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a7a7/3748764/7150fd91b816/toxsci_kft138_f0003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a7a7/3748764/9226c23fdc8a/toxsci_kft138_m0001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a7a7/3748764/fe89a4e740d1/toxsci_kft138_f0004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a7a7/3748764/c14ef76e6a4c/toxsci_kft138_f0005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a7a7/3748764/08dc9e4560dc/toxsci_kft138_f0006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a7a7/3748764/67ce2300d76a/toxsci_kft138_f0007.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a7a7/3748764/653910ebbd9e/toxsci_kft138_f0008.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a7a7/3748764/2cd8b885d54c/toxsci_kft138_f0009.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/a7a7/3748764/7ac1fb1f9103/toxsci_kft138_f0010.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

The 14-3-3 proteins of Arabidopsis regulate root growth and chloroplast development as components of the photosensory system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3350920/,"The 14-3-3 proteins specifically bind a number of client proteins to influence important pathways, including flowering timing via the photosensory system. For instance, 14-3-3 proteins influence the photosensory system through interactions with Constans (CO) protein. 14-3-3 associations with the photosensory system were further studied in this investigation using 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants to study root and chloroplast development. The 14-3-3 μ T-DNA insertion mutant, 14-3-3μ-1 , had shorter roots than the wild type and the difference in root length could be influenced by light intensity. The 14-3-3 ν T-DNA insertion mutants also had shorter roots, but only when grown under narrow-bandwidth red light. Five-day-old 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion and co mutants all had increased root greening compared with the wild type, which was influenced by light wavelength and intensity. However, beyond 10 d of growth, 14-3-3μ-1 roots did not increase in greening as much as wild-type roots. This study reveals new developmental roles of 14-3-3 proteins in roots and chloroplasts, probably via association with the photosensory system.

14-3-3 phosphoprotein interaction networks - does isoform diversity present functional interaction specification?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3422896/,"The 14-3-3 proteins have emerged as major phosphoprotein interaction proteins and thereby constitute a key node in the Arabidopsis Interactome Map, a node through which a large number of important signals pass. Throughout their history of discovery and description, the 14-3-3s have been described as protein families and there has been some evidence that the different 14-3-3 family members within any organism might carry isoform-specific functions. However, there has also been evidence for redundancy of 14-3-3 function, suggesting that the perceived 14-3-3 diversity may be the accumulation of neutral mutations over evolutionary time and as some 14-3-3 genes develop tissue or organ-specific expression. This situation has led to a currently unresolved question – does 14-3-3 isoform sequence diversity indicate functional diversity at the biochemical or cellular level? We discuss here some of the key observations on both sides of the resulting debate, and present a set of contrastable observations to address the theory functional diversity does exist among 14-3-3 isoforms. The resulting model suggests strongly that there are indeed functional specificities in the 14-3-3s of Arabidopsis. The model further suggests that 14-3-3 diversity and specificity should enter into the discussion of 14-3-3 roles in signal transduction and be directly approached in 14-3-3 experimentation. It is hoped that future studies involving 14-3-3s will continue to address specificity in experimental design and analysis.

Spaceflight transcriptomes: unique responses to a novel environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10712242/,"Spaceflight presents a unique environment with complex stressors, including microgravity and radiation, that can influence plant physiology at molecular levels. Combining transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, this research gives insights into the coordination of transcriptome and proteome in Arabidopsis’ molecular and physiological responses to Spaceflight environmental stress. Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated and grown in microgravity (µ g ) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in NASA Biological Research in Canisters – Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED) hardware, with the ground control established on Earth. At 10 days old, seedlings were frozen in RNA-later and returned to Earth. RNA-seq transcriptomics and TMT-labeled LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of cellular fractionates from the plant tissues suggest the alteration of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) in spaceflight, with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. An overview of the ribosome, spliceosome, and proteasome activities in spaceflight revealed a significant abundance of transcripts and proteins involved in protease binding, nuclease activities, and mRNA binding in spaceflight, while those involved in tRNA binding, exoribonuclease activity, and RNA helicase activity were less abundant in spaceflight. CELLULOSE SYNTHASES (CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA7) and CELLULOSE-LIKE PROTEINS (CSLE1, CSLG3), involved in cellulose deposition and TUBULIN COFACTOR B (TFCB) had reduced abundance in spaceflight. This contrasts with the increased expression of UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs, involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight. Both transcripts and proteome suggested an altered polar auxin redistribution, lipid, and ionic intracellular transportation in spaceflight. Analyses also suggest an increased metabolic energy requirement for plants in Space than on Earth, hence, the activation of several shunt metabolic pathways. This study provides novel insights, based on integrated RNA and protein data, on how plants adapt to the spaceflight environment and it is a step further at achieving sustainable crop production in Space.

Organ-specific remodeling of the Arabidopsis transcriptome in response to spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10058394/,"Plants have been recognized as key components of bioregenerative life support systems for space exploration, and many experiments have been carried out to evaluate their adaptability to spaceflight. Unfortunately, few of these experiments have involved monocot plants, which constitute most of the crops used on Earth as sources of food, feed, and fiber. To better understand the ability of monocot plants to adapt to spaceflight, we germinated and grew Brachypodium distachyon seedlings of the Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8 accessions in a customized growth unit on the International Space Station, along with 1-g ground controls. At the end of a 4-day growth period, seedling organ’s growth and morphologies were quantified, and root and shoot transcriptomic profiles were investigated using RNA-seq. The roots of all three accessions grew more slowly and displayed longer root hairs under microgravity conditions relative to ground control. On the other hand, the shoots of Bd21-3 and Gaz-8 grew at similar rates between conditions, whereas those of Bd21 grew more slowly under microgravity. The three Brachypodium accessions displayed dramatically different transcriptomic responses to microgravity relative to ground controls, with the largest numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found in Gaz8 (4527), followed by Bd21 (1353) and Bd21-3 (570). Only 47 and six DEGs were shared between accessions for shoots and roots, respectively, including DEGs encoding wall-associated proteins and photosynthesis-related DEGs. Furthermore, DEGs associated with the “Oxidative Stress Response” GO group were up-regulated in the shoots and down-regulated in the roots of Bd21 and Gaz8, indicating that Brachypodium roots and shoots deploy distinct biological strategies to adapt to the microgravity environment. A comparative analysis of the Brachypodium oxidative-stress response DEGs with the Arabidopsis ROS wheel suggests a connection between retrograde signaling, light response, and decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes in microgravity-exposed shoots. In Gaz8, DEGs were also found to preferentially associate with the “Plant Hormonal Signaling” and “MAP Kinase Signaling” KEGG pathways. Overall, these data indicate that Brachypodium distachyon seedlings exposed to the microgravity environment of ISS display accession- and organ-specific responses that involve oxidative stress response, wall remodeling, photosynthesis inhibition, expression regulation, ribosome biogenesis, and post-translational modifications. The general characteristics of these responses are similar to those displayed by microgravity-exposed Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. However, organ- and accession-specific components of the response dramatically differ both within and between species. These results suggest a need to directly evaluate candidate-crop responses to microgravity to better understand their specific adaptability to this novel environment and develop cultivation strategies allowing them to strive during spaceflight.

A method for preparing spaceflight RNAlater-fixed Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae) tissue for scanning electron microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4103452/,"• Premise of the study: In spaceflight experiments, tissues for morphologic study are fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde, while tissues for molecular study are fixed in RNA later ; thus, an experiment containing both study components requires multiple fixation strategies. The possibility of using RNA later -fixed materials for standard SEM-based morphometric investigation was explored to expand the library of tissues available for analysis and maximize usage of samples returned from spaceflight, but these technologies have wide application to any situation where recovery of biological resources is limited.
• Methods and Results: RNA later -fixed samples were desalinated in distilled water, dehydrated through graded methanol, plunged into liquid ethane, and transferred to cryovials for freeze-substitution. Sample tissues were critical point dried, mounted, sputter-coated, and imaged.
• Conclusions: The protocol resulted in acceptable SEM images from RNA later -fixed Arabidopsis thaliana tissue. The majority of the tissues remained intact, including general morphology and finer details such as root hairs and trichomes.

Experimental flexibility is a luxury often taken for granted in typical laboratory science. Adapting a protocol in response to unfolding information as the experiment proceeds is a key element in discovery and is standard practice. In spaceflight, this luxury is not as accessible; crew time is highly regulated, orbital resources are limited, and protocols are tightly controlled once in place. In addition, the up-mass available to each researcher is limited, which restricts the choices of experimental treatments and orbital fixation options. These constraints often translate into hard choices that limit the scientific return on investment, including sacrificing the number of replicates to enable additional treatment and fixation scenarios. As a consequence, options that allow maximization of the data obtained from a single sample are highly valued.
Biological experiments are typically required to be segregated based on the analyses to be performed upon return from spaceflight. These segregated conditions are usually either molecular or morphological, due to the separate fixatives required for each application (e.g., Stutte et al., 2006 ). Investigations focused on transcriptome analyses, for instance, would not be likely to commit a portion of their limited up-mass on samples and associated fixation hardware for morphological applications, and would miss the opportunity to use both morphological and molecular perspectives. These limitations are keenly felt in scenarios where the transcriptome analyses reveal spaceflight-specific patterns of gene expression central to morphological patterns of cell growth and development. This scenario was encountered in a recent spaceflight experiment, in which telemetric imaging revealed interesting spaceflight-associated root morphologies ( Paul et al., 2012 ). All material was fixed on orbit in RNA later (Ambion, Grand Island, New York, USA) to facilitate transcriptome analyses on returned samples.
Although it is possible to partition an experiment into molecular and morphological components, using samples that correspond directly to those used in molecular applications would be of extreme value. A single fixation protocol better enables the full use of replicates to support a robust power analysis; all plant material allowed by the up-mass constraints can be dedicated to a single application per orbital treatment. Additionally, the plant material apportioned for microscopy can be taken directly from the pool of material whose balance represents a molecular replicate; thus, any morphologic change seen in these plants would directly reflect the effects of the altered gene expressions from those same plants. Terrestrial field studies could also benefit from this single fixative approach for similar reasons.
Despite its use as a molecular fixative, RNA later is not commonly used as a morphologic fixative. RNA later fixation produces unclear images with high background staining ( Cadoret et al., 2013 ) and reduces immunofluorescent signals ( Zaitoun et al., 2010 ; Paul and Ferl, 2011 ). This intracellular occlusion eliminates the possibility of clear subcellular localizations. However, the external morphology appears to be preserved in a fresh-like state, which suggests that RNA later may be acceptable for use in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Two cases in the literature report the use of RNA later in a morphological investigation. Behrendt et al. (2011) reported that coral covered in crustose coralline algae was fixed in RNA later , postfixed in 2% glutaraldehyde, rinsed in sodium cacodylate, and postfixed again in OsO 4 prior to SEM investigations. Hofer et al. (2012) used SEM in their study on floral organs of Clermontia species using RNA later as their main fixative with a hexamethyldisilazane drying step. In the current study, both of the above techniques resulted in significant tissue damage in Arabidopsis .
An alternative to fixation in SEM sample preparation is freezing. Cryo-SEM does not require prior fixation, but instead preserves tissues in a fresh-like state for imaging ( Koroleva et al., 2010 ; Sarsby et al., 2012 ; Yu et al., 2013 ). However, few laboratories have access to such equipment, and the equipment and operation can often be expensive. Therefore, this study investigated the possibility of emulating cryo-SEM on a standard SEM, a “cryo-analog,” where tissue would first be returned to a fresh-like state for freezing prior to imaging.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-appsinps.gif"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4812/4103452/271868273757/apps.1300034fig1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4812/4103452/4c936e925a0b/apps.1300034fig2.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
ARG1 Functions in the Physiological Adaptation of Undifferentiated Plant Cells to Spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8024390/,"Scientific access to spaceflight and especially the International Space Station has revealed that physiological adaptation to spaceflight is accompanied or enabled by changes in gene expression that significantly alter the transcriptome of cells in spaceflight. A wide range of experiments have shown that plant physiological adaptation to spaceflight involves gene expression changes that alter cell wall and other metabolisms. However, while transcriptome profiling aptly illuminates changes in gene expression that accompany spaceflight adaptation, mutation analysis is required to illuminate key elements required for that adaptation.
Here we report how transcriptome profiling was used to gain insight into the spaceflight adaptation role of Altered response to gravity 1 ( Arg1 ), a gene known to affect gravity responses in plants on Earth. The study compared expression profiles of cultured lines of Arabidopsis thaliana derived from wild-type (WT) cultivar Col-0 to profiles from a knock-out line deficient in the gene encoding ARG1 (ARG1 KO), both on the ground and in space. The cell lines were launched on SpaceX CRS-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment of the BRIC-17 spaceflight mission. The cultured cell lines were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) hardware. Spaceflight samples were fixed on orbit. Differentially expressed genes were identified between the two environments (spaceflight and comparable ground controls) and the two genotypes (WT and ARG1 KO). Each genotype engaged unique genes during physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, with little overlap. Most of the genes altered in expression in spaceflight in WT cells were found to be Arg1 -dependent, suggesting a major role for that gene in the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated cells to spaceflight.

A Member of the CONSTANS-Like Protein Family is a Putative Regulator of ROS Homeostasis and Spaceflight Physiological Adaptation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6348315/,"A feature of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in Arabidopsis thaliana ( Arabidopsis ) is the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated gene expression. The patterns of ROS-associated gene expression vary among Arabidopsis ecotypes, and the role of ROS signalling in spaceflight acclimation is unknown. What could differences in ROS gene regulation between ecotypes on orbit reveal about physiological adaptation to novel environments? Analyses of ecotype-dependent responses to spaceflight resulted in the elucidation of a previously uncharacterized gene ( OMG1 ) as being ROS-associated. The OMG1 5′ flanking region is an active promoter in cells where ROS activity is commonly observed, such as in pollen tubes, root hairs, and in other tissues upon wounding. qRT-PCR analyses revealed that upon wounding on Earth, OMG1 is an apparent transcriptional regulator of MYB77 and GRX480 , which are associated with the ROS pathway. Fluorescence-based ROS assays show that OMG1 affects ROS production. Phylogenetic analysis of OMG1 and closely related homologs suggests that OMG1 is a distant, unrecognized member of the CONSTANS-Like protein family, a member that arose via gene duplication early in the angiosperm lineage and subsequently lost its first DNA-binding B-box1 domain. These data illustrate that members of the rapidly evolving COL protein family play a role in regulating ROS pathway functions, and their differential regulation on orbit suggests a role for ROS signalling in spaceflight physiological adaptation.

Plants adjust to spaceflight by changing patterns of gene expression. The analysis of how different Arabidopsis plants respond to space resulted in the discovery of a previously uncharacterized gene ( OMG1 ), which was consistently induced in space. This research revealed that OMG1 belongs to the CONSTANS-Like protein family and is involved in maintaining the reactive oxygen species pathway, which appears to be an important feature of the physiological adaptation of plants to the spaceflight environment. It also shows that spaceflight experiments can be used as a platform to discover novel gene function and provide further insights into terrestrial plant biology.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-aobpla.gif"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2b01/6348315/3d706d771869/ply07501.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2b01/6348315/a9147a98db43/ply07502.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2b01/6348315/d5701732ce32/ply07503.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2b01/6348315/316f0db15a8b/ply07504.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2b01/6348315/ec8e70aeeb63/ply07505.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2b01/6348315/031259ab5d11/ply07506.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2b01/6348315/9461987ccdca/ply07507.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2b01/6348315/9faf475eab34/ply07508.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2b01/6348315/53b865a4b539/ply07509.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/2b01/6348315/d6a7474e9337/ply07510.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
HSFA2 Functions in the Physiological Adaptation of Undifferentiated Plant Cells to Spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6359015/,"Heat Shock Factor A2 (HsfA2) is part of the Heat Shock Factor (HSF) network, and plays an essential role beyond heat shock in environmental stress responses and cellular homeostatic control. Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures derived from wild type (WT) ecotype Col-0 and a knockout line deficient in the gene encoding HSFA2 (HSFA2 KO) were grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to ascertain whether the HSF network functions in the adaptation to the novel environment of spaceflight. Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part comparative approach. First, genes differentially expressed between the two environments (spaceflight to ground) were identified within the same genotype, which represented physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Second, gene expression profiles were compared between the two genotypes (HSFA2 KO to WT) within the same environment, which defined genes uniquely required by each genotype on the ground and in spaceflight-adapted states. Results showed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) define the HSFA2 KO cells’ physiological state irrespective of the environment, and likely resulted from a deficiency in the chaperone-mediated protein folding machinery in the mutant. Results further suggested that additional to its universal stress response role, HsfA2 also has specific roles in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight through cell wall remodeling, signal perception and transduction, and starch biosynthesis. Disabling HsfA2 altered the physiological state of the cells, and impacted the mechanisms induced to adapt to spaceflight, and identified HsfA2 -dependent genes that are important to the adaption of wild type cells to spaceflight. Collectively these data indicate a non-thermal role for the HSF network in spaceflight adaptation.

Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio: A biomarker to monitor the immune status of astronauts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7667275/,"A comprehensive understanding of spaceflight factors involved in immune dysfunction and the evaluation of biomarkers to assess in-flight astronaut health are essential goals for NASA. An elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a potential biomarker candidate, as leukocyte differentials are altered during spaceflight. In the reduced gravity environment of space, rodents and astronauts displayed elevated NLR and granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratios (GLR), respectively. To simulate microgravity using two well-established ground-based models, we cultured human whole blood-leukocytes in high-aspect rotating wall vessels (HARV-RWV) and used hindlimb unloaded (HU) mice. Both HARV-RWV simulation of leukocytes and HU-exposed mice showed elevated NLR profiles comparable to spaceflight exposed samples. To assess mechanisms involved, we found the simulated microgravity HARV-RWV model resulted in an imbalance of redox processes and activation of myeloperoxidase-producing inflammatory neutrophils, while antioxidant treatment reversed these effects. In the simulated microgravity HU model, mitochondrial catalase-transgenic mice that have reduced oxidative stress responses showed reduced neutrophil counts, NLR, and a dampened release of selective inflammatory cytokines compared to wildtype HU mice, suggesting simulated microgravity induced oxidative stress responses that triggered inflammation. In brief, both spaceflight and simulated microgravity models caused elevated NLR, indicating this as a potential biomarker for future in-flight immune health monitoring.

Immunological and hematological outcomes following protracted low dose/low dose rate ionizing radiation and simulated microgravity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8169688/,"Using a ground-based model to simulate spaceflight [21-days of single-housed, hindlimb unloading (HLU) combined with continuous low-dose gamma irradiation (LDR, total dose of 0.04 Gy)], an in-depth survey of the immune and hematological systems of mice at 7-days post-exposure was performed. Collected blood was profiled with a hematology analyzer and spleens were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-sequencing). The results revealed negligible differences in immune differentials. However, hematological system analyses of whole blood indicated large disparities in red blood cell differentials and morphology, suggestive of anemia. Murine Reactome networks indicated majority of spleen cells displayed differentially expressed genes (DEG) involved in signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization, and DNA repair. Although immune differentials were not changed, DEG analysis of the spleen revealed expression profiles associated with inflammation and dysregulated immune function persist to 1-week post-simulated spaceflight. Additionally, specific regulation pathways associated with human blood disease gene orthologs, such as blood pressure regulation, transforming growth factor-β receptor signaling, and B cell differentiation were noted. Collectively, this study revealed differential immune and hematological outcomes 1-week post-simulated spaceflight conditions, suggesting recovery from spaceflight is an unremitting process.

Epigenomic regulators elongator complex subunit 2 and methyltransferase 1 differentially condition the spaceflight response in Arabidopsis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8475764/,"Background: Plants subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight show transcriptomic changes that resemble aspects of several terrestrial abiotic stress responses. Under investigation here is whether epigenetic modulations, similar to those that occur in terrestrial stress responses, have a functional role in spaceflight physiological adaptation. The Advanced Plant Experiment-04 – Epigenetic Expression experiment examined the role of cytosine methylation in spaceflight adaptation. The experiment was conducted onboard the International Space Station, and evaluated the spaceflight-altered, genome-wide methylation profiles of two methylation-regulating gene mutants [methyltransferase 1 ( met1-7) and elongator complex subunit 2 ( elp2-5 )] along with a wild-type Col-0 control.
Results: The elp2-5 plants suffered in their physiological adaptation to spaceflight in that their roots failed to extend away from the seed and the overall development of the plants was greatly impaired in space. The met1-7 plants suffered less, with their morphology affected by spaceflight in a manner similar to that of the Col-0 controls. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in spaceflight were dramatically different in the elp2-5 and met1-7 plants compared to Col-0, indicating that the disruptions in these mutants resulted in a reprogramming of their spaceflight responses, especially in elp2-5 . Many of the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome of each genotype were differentially methylated in spaceflight. In Col-0 the majority of the DEGs were representative of the now familiar spaceflight response, which includes genes associated with cell wall remodeling, pathogen responses and ROS signaling. However, the spaceflight transcriptomes of met1-7 and elp2-5 each presented patterns of DEGs that are almost completely different than Col-0, and to each other. Further, the DEGs of the mutant genotypes suggest a more severe spaceflight stress response in the mutants, particularly in elp2-5 .
Conclusion: Arabidopsis physiological adaptation to spaceflight results in differential DNA methylation in an organ-specific manner. Disruption of Met1 methyltransferase function does not dramatically affect spaceflight growth or morphology, yet met1-7 reprograms the spaceflight transcriptomic response in a unique manner. Disruption of elp2-5 results in poor development in spaceflight grown plants, together with a diminished, dramatically reprogrammed transcriptomic response.

Plants grown in Apollo lunar regolith present stress-associated transcriptomes that inform prospects for lunar exploration,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9098553/,"The extent to which plants can enhance human life support on other worlds depends on the ability of plants to thrive in extraterrestrial environments using in-situ resources. Using samples from Apollo 11, 12, and 17, we show that the terrestrial plant Arabidopsis thaliana germinates and grows in diverse lunar regoliths. However, our results show that growth is challenging; the lunar regolith plants were slow to develop and many showed severe stress morphologies. Moreover, all plants grown in lunar soils differentially expressed genes indicating ionic stresses, similar to plant reactions to salt, metal and reactive oxygen species. Therefore, although in situ lunar regoliths can be useful for plant production in lunar habitats, they are not benign substrates. The interaction between plants and lunar regolith will need to be further elucidated, and likely mitigated, to best enable efficient use of lunar regolith for life support within lunar stations.

Utilizing the KSC fixation tube to conduct human-tended plant biology experiments on a suborbital spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9693084/,"Suborbital spaceflights now enable human-tended research investigating short-term gravitational effects in biological systems, eliminating the need for complex automation. Here, we discuss a method utilizing KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs) to both carry biology to suborbital space as well as fix that biology at certain stages of flight. Plants on support media were inserted into the sample side of KFTs preloaded with RNAlater in the fixation chamber. The KFTs were activated at various stages of a simulated flight to fix the plants. RNA-seq analysis conducted on tissue samples housed in KFTs, showed that plants behaved consistently in KFTs when compared to petri-plates. Over the time course, roots adjusted to hypoxia and leaves adjusted to changes in photosynthesis. These responses were due in part to the environment imposed by the encased triple containment of the KFTs, which is a requirement for flight in human spacecraft. While plants exhibited expected reproducible transcriptomic alteration over time in the KFTs, responses to clinorotation during the simulated flight suggest that transcriptomic responses to suborbital spaceflight can be examined using this approach.

Post-Spaceflight (STS-135) Mouse Splenocytes Demonstrate Altered Activation Properties and Surface Molecule Expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4430214/,"Alterations in immune function have been documented during or post-spaceflight and in ground based models of microgravity. Identification of immune parameters that are dysregulated during spaceflight is an important step in mitigating crew health risks during deep space missions. The in vitro analysis of leukocyte activity post-spaceflight in both human and animal species is primarily focused on lymphocytic function. This report completes a broader spectrum analysis of mouse lymphocyte and monocyte changes post 13 days orbital flight (mission STS-135). Analysis includes an examination in surface markers for cell activation, and antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules. Cytokine production was measured after stimulation with T-cell mitogen or TLR-2, TLR-4, or TLR-5 agonists. Splenocyte surface marker analysis immediate post-spaceflight and after in vitro culture demonstrated unique changes in phenotypic populations between the flight mice and matched treatment ground controls. Post-spaceflight splenocytes (flight splenocytes) had lower expression intensity of CD4 + CD25 + and CD8 + CD25 + cells, lower percentage of CD11c + MHC II + cells, and higher percentage of CD11c + MHC I + populations compared to ground controls. The flight splenocytes demonstrated an increase in phagocytic activity. Stimulation with ConA led to decrease in CD4 + population but increased CD4 + CD25 + cells compared to ground controls. Culturing with TLR agonists led to a decrease in CD11c + population in splenocytes isolated from flight mice compared to ground controls. Consequently, flight splenocytes with or without TLR-agonist stimulation showed a decrease in CD11c + MHC I + , CD11c + MHC II + , and CD11c + CD86 + cells compared to ground controls. Production of IFN-γ was decreased and IL-2 was increased from ConA stimulated flight splenocytes.

This study evaluated C57BL/6 mice on Day 40 after total-body 56 Fe 26+ irradiation at 0, 1, 2 and 3 gray (Gy). Radiation consistently increased thymus mass (one-way ANOVA: P < 0.005); spleen, liver and lung masses were similar among all groups. In the blood, there was no radiation effect on the white blood cell (WBC) count or major leukocyte types. However, the red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit and the CD8+ T cytotoxic (Tc) cell count and percentage all decreased, while both the CD4:CD8 (Th:Tc) cell ratio and spontaneous blastogenesis increased, in one or more irradiated groups compared with unirradiated controls ( P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). In contrast, splenic WBC, lymphocyte, B cell and T helper (Th) counts, %B cells and the CD4:CD8 ratio were all significantly elevated, while Tc percentages decreased, in one or more of the irradiated groups compared with controls ( P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). Although there were trends for minor, radiation-induced increases in %CD11b+ granulocytes in the spleen, cells double-labeled with adhesion markers (CD11b+CD54+, CD11b+CD62E+) were normal. Splenocyte spontaneous blastogenesis and that induced by mitogens (PHA, ConA, LPS) was equivalent to normal. In bone marrow, the percentage of cells expressing stem cell markers, Sca-1 and CD34/Sca-1, were low in one or more of the irradiated groups ( P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). Collectively, the data indicate that significant immunological abnormalities still exist more than a month after 56 Fe irradiation and that there are differences dependent upon body compartment.

Is spaceflight-induced immune dysfunction linked to systemic changes in metabolism?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5443495/,"The Space Shuttle Atlantis launched on its final mission (STS-135) on July 8, 2011. After just under 13 days, the shuttle landed safely at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for the last time. Female C57BL/6J mice flew as part of the Commercial Biomedical Testing Module-3 (CBTM-3) payload. Ground controls were maintained at the KSC facility. Subsets of these mice were made available to investigators as part of NASA’s Bio-specimen Sharing Program (BSP). Our group characterized cell phenotype distributions and phagocytic function in the spleen, catecholamine and corticosterone levels in the adrenal glands, and transcriptomics/metabolomics in the liver. Despite decreases in most splenic leukocyte subsets, there were increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related activity. Although there were increases noted in corticosterone levels in both the adrenals and liver, there were no significant changes in catecholamine levels. Furthermore, functional analysis of gene expression and metabolomic profiles suggest that the functional changes are not due to oxidative or psychological stress. Despite changes in gene expression patterns indicative of increases in phagocytic activity (e.g. endocytosis and formation of peroxisomes), there was no corresponding increase in genes related to ROS metabolism. In contrast, there were increases in expression profiles related to fatty acid oxidation with decreases in glycolysis-related profiles. Given the clear link between immune function and metabolism in many ground-based diseases, we propose a similar link may be involved in spaceflight-induced decrements in immune and metabolic function.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f858/5443495/834c0841fc13/pone.0174174.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f858/5443495/8ecaaf649c8d/pone.0174174.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f858/5443495/95f5a60b6e3c/pone.0174174.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f858/5443495/6e614deda532/pone.0174174.g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f858/5443495/c44331278dd0/pone.0174174.g005.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Spaceflight Activates Autophagy Programs and the Proteasome in Mouse Liver,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666744/,"Increased oxidative stress is an unavoidable consequence of exposure to the space environment. Our previous studies showed that mice exposed to space for 13.5 days had decreased glutathione levels, suggesting impairments in oxidative defense. Here we performed unbiased, unsupervised and integrated multi-‘omic analyses of metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets from mice flown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis. Enrichment analyses of metabolite and gene sets showed significant changes in osmolyte concentrations and pathways related to glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, likely consequences of relative dehydration of the spaceflight mice. However, we also found increased enrichment of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and purine metabolic pathways, concomitant with enrichment of genes associated with autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome. When taken together with a downregulation in nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2-mediated signaling, our analyses suggest that decreased hepatic oxidative defense may lead to aberrant tRNA post-translational processing, induction of degradation programs and senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in response to the spaceflight environment.

Vive la radior√©sistance!: Converging research in radiobiology and biogerontology to enhance human radioresistance for deep space exploration and colonization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5865701/,"While many efforts have been made to pave the way toward human space colonization, little consideration has been given to the methods of protecting spacefarers against harsh cosmic and local radioactive environments and the high costs associated with protection from the deleterious physiological effects of exposure to high-Linear energy transfer (high-LET) radiation. Herein, we lay the foundations of a roadmap toward enhancing human radioresistance for the purposes of deep space colonization and exploration. We outline future research directions toward the goal of enhancing human radioresistance, including upregulation of endogenous repair and radioprotective mechanisms, possible leeways into gene therapy in order to enhance radioresistance via the translation of exogenous and engineered DNA repair and radioprotective mechanisms, the substitution of organic molecules with fortified isoforms, and methods of slowing metabolic activity while preserving cognitive function. We conclude by presenting the known associations between radioresistance and longevity, and articulating the position that enhancing human radioresistance is likely to extend the healthspan of human spacefarers as well.

Proteomic analysis of mouse brain subjected to spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6337482/,"There is evidence that spaceflight poses acute and late risks to the central nervous system. To explore possible mechanisms, the proteomic changes following spaceflight in mouse brain were characterized. Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 13-day mission. Within 3–5 h after landing, brain tissue was collected to evaluate protein expression profiles using quantitative proteomic analysis. Our results showed that there were 26 proteins that were significantly altered after spaceflight in the gray and/or white matter. While there was no overlap between the white and gray matter in terms of individual proteins, there was overlap in terms of function, synaptic plasticity, vesical activity, protein/organelle transport, and metabolism. Our data demonstrate that exposure to the spaceflight environment induces significant changes in protein expression related to neuronal structure and metabolic function. This might lead to a significant impact on brain structural and functional integrity that could affect the outcome of space missions.

Transcriptomic effects on the mouse heart following 30 days on the International Space Station.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9953463/,"Efforts to understand the impact of spaceflight on the human body stem from growing interest in long-term space travel. Multiple organ systems are affected by microgravity and radiation, including the cardiovascular system. Previous transcriptomic studies have sought to reveal the changes in gene expression after spaceflight. However, little is known about the impact of long-term spaceflight on the mouse heart in vivo. This study focuses on the transcriptomic changes in the hearts of female C57BL/6J mice flown on the International Space Station (ISS) for 30 days. RNA was isolated from the hearts of three flight and three comparable ground control mice and RNA sequencing was performed. Our analyses showed that 1147 transcripts were significantly regulated after spaceflight. The MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and GPCR signaling pathways were predicted to be activated. Transcripts related to cytoskeleton breakdown and organization were upregulated, but no significant change in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components or oxidative stress pathway-associated transcripts occurred. Our results indicate an absence of cellular senescence, and a significant upregulation of transcripts associated with the cell cycle. Transcripts related to cellular maintenance and survival were most affected by spaceflight, suggesting that cardiovascular transcriptome initiates an adaptive response to long-term spaceflight.

Spaceflight-induced gene expression profiles in the mouse brain are attenuated by treatment with the antioxidant BuOE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10487739/,"The demands of deep space pose a health risk to the central nervous system that has long been a concern when sending humans to space. While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, a greater understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE). Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes due to spaceflight in each of the four brain regions. Both common and region-specific transcriptomic responses were observed. Metabolic pathways and pathways sensitive to oxidative stress were enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight. These findings enhance our understanding of brain regional variation in susceptibility to spaceflight conditions. BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of genes, suggesting that this compound may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage caused by the spaceflight environment.

Basal signaling regulates plant growth and development,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11942576/,"The proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinase ( PERK ) gene family is crucial to various molecular and cellular processes in plants. We identified 50 PERK genes in Brassica napus to explore their evolutionary dynamics, structural diversity, and functional roles. These genes were grouped into four classes and unevenly distributed across 18 chromosomes. Phylogenetic studies and Ka/Ks ratios revealed purifying selection during the evolution process. They exhibited significant diversification in gene length, molecular weight, and isoelectric points, suggesting specialized function. Gene structure and motif analyses revealed variations among the BnPERK family members, with conserved tyrosine kinase domains suggesting functional importance. Cis -element analysis predicted the involvement in hormone signaling and stress responses. Expression profiling showed diverse patterns across tissues and hormone treatments, highlighting potential roles in growth regulation and hormone signaling. Protein–protein interaction networks suggested BnPERK proteins interact with a wide array of proteins, implicating them in multiple biological processes. The transcriptional downregulation of four BnPERK genes upon Plasmodiophora brassicae infection implied a role in clubroot disease response. Furthermore, the Arabidopsis perk9 mutant displayed relieved disease severity and enhanced basal immune response, suggesting the negative role of PERK9 in plant immunity. The study highlighted the potential role of BnPERKs in crop improvement strategies against clubroot disease.

Phosphoinositide-signaling is one component of a robust plant defense response,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4052902/,"The phosphoinositide pathway and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP 3 ) have been implicated in plant responses to many abiotic stresses; however, their role in response to biotic stress is not well characterized. In the current study, we show that both basal defense and systemic acquired resistance responses are affected in transgenic plants constitutively expressing the human type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase) which have greatly reduced InsP 3 levels. Flagellin induced Ca 2+ -release as well as the expressions of some flg22 responsive genes were attenuated in the InsP 5-ptase plants. Furthermore, the InsP 5-ptase plants were more susceptible to virulent and avirulent strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato ( Pst ) DC3000 . The InsP 5-ptase plants had lower basal salicylic acid (SA) levels and the induction of SAR in systemic leaves was reduced and delayed. Reciprocal exudate experiments showed that although the InsP 5-ptase plants produced equally effective molecules that could trigger PR-1 gene expression in wild type plants, exudates collected from either wild type or InsP 5-ptase plants triggered less PR-1 gene expression in InsP 5-ptase plants. Additionally, expression profiles indicated that several defense genes including PR-1 , PR-2 , PR-5 , and AIG1 were basally down regulated in the InsP 5-ptase plants compared with wild type. Upon pathogen attack, expression of these genes was either not induced or showed delayed induction in systemic leaves. Our study shows that phosphoinositide signaling is one component of the plant defense network and is involved in both basal and systemic responses. The dampening of InsP 3 -mediated signaling affects Ca 2+ release, modulates defense gene expression and compromises plant defense responses.

Uncovering transcriptional responses to fractional gravity in Arabidopsis roots,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8539686/,"Although many reports characterize the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis seedlings to microgravity, few investigate the effect of partial or fractional gravity on gene expression. Understanding plant responses to fractional gravity is relevant for plant growth on lunar and Martian surfaces. The plant signaling flight experiment utilized the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) onboard the International Space Station (ISS). The EMCS consisted of two rotors within a controlled chamber allowing for two experimental conditions, microgravity (stationary rotor) and simulated gravity in space. Seedlings were grown for 5 days under continuous light in seed cassettes. The arrangement of the seed cassettes within each experimental container results in a gradient of fractional g (in the spinning rotor). To investigate whether gene expression patterns are sensitive to fractional g , we carried out transcriptional profiling of root samples exposed to microgravity or partial g (ranging from 0.53 to 0.88 g ). Data were analyzed using DESeq2 with fractional g as a continuous variable in the design model in order to query gene expression across the gravity continuum. We identified a subset of genes whose expression correlates with changes in fractional g . Interestingly, the most responsive genes include those encoding transcription factors, defense, and cell wall-related proteins and heat shock proteins.

Simulated microgravity impairs human NK [natural killer] cell cytotoxic activity against space radiation-relevant leukemic cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11324864/,"Natural killer (NK) cells are an important first-line of defense against malignant cells. Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity present during spaceflight affects the body’s defenses against leukemogenesis. Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (sμG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous sμG. This brief exposure to sμG markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous sμG. RNA-seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which sμG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that μG may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO.

Multi-analyte biochip (MAB) based on all-solid-state ion-selective electrodes (ASSISE) for physiological research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665236/,"Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) applications in environmental, biomedical, agricultural, biological, and spaceflight research require an ion-selective electrode (ISE) that can withstand prolonged storage in complex biological media 1-4 . An all-solid-state ion-selective-electrode (ASSISE) is especially attractive for the aforementioned applications. The electrode should have the following favorable characteristics: easy construction, low maintenance, and (potential for) miniaturization, allowing for batch processing. A microfabricated ASSISE intended for quantifying H + , Ca 2+ , and CO 3 2- ions was constructed. It consists of a noble-metal electrode layer ( i.e. Pt), a transduction layer, and an ion-selective membrane (ISM) layer. The transduction layer functions to transduce the concentration-dependent chemical potential of the ion-selective membrane into a measurable electrical signal.
The lifetime of an ASSISE is found to depend on maintaining the potential at the conductive layer/membrane interface 5-7 . To extend the ASSISE working lifetime and thereby maintain stable potentials at the interfacial layers, we utilized the conductive polymer (CP) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) 7-9 in place of silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) as the transducer layer. We constructed the ASSISE in a lab-on-a-chip format, which we called the multi-analyte biochip (MAB) ( Figure 1 ).
Calibrations in test solutions demonstrated that the MAB can monitor pH (operational range pH 4-9), CO 3 2- (measured range 0.01 mM - 1 mM), and Ca 2+ (log-linear range 0.01 mM to 1 mM). The MAB for pH provides a near-Nernstian slope response after almost one month storage in algal medium. The carbonate biochips show a potentiometric profile similar to that of a conventional ion-selective electrode. Physiological measurements were employed to monitor biological activity of the model system, the microalga Chlorella vulgaris .
The MAB conveys an advantage in size, versatility, and multiplexed analyte sensing capability, making it applicable to many confined monitoring situations, on Earth or in space.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-jove.gif"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0e8c/3665236/2c1baa03986d/jove-74-50020-0.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0e8c/3665236/99b1cbd776b8/jove-74-50020-1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0e8c/3665236/357cc8875d5b/jove-74-50020-2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0e8c/3665236/06690fd75088/jove-74-50020-3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0e8c/3665236/5925ef9fb5be/jove-74-50020-4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0e8c/3665236/448b36c08c16/jove-74-50020-5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0e8c/3665236/856ab4c1feb5/jove-74-50020-6.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0e8c/3665236/0ed5b8d584fc/jove-74-50020-7.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0e8c/3665236/b24c46b05279/jove-74-50020-8.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Lab-on-a-chip approaches for space-biology research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10470837/,"The space race is entering a new era of exploration, in which the number of robotic and human missions to various places in our solar system is rapidly increasing. Despite the recent advances in propulsion and life support technologies, there is a growing need to perform analytical measurements and laboratory experiments across diverse domains of science, while keeping low payload requirements. In this context, lab-on-a-chip nanobiosensors appear to be an emerging technology capable of revolutionizing space exploration, given their low footprint, high accuracy, and low payload requirements. To date, only some approaches for monitoring astronaut health in spacecraft environments have been reported. Although non-invasive molecular diagnostics, like lab-on-a-chip technology, are expected to improve the quality of long-term space missions, their application to monitor microbiological and environmental variables is rarely reported, even for analogous extreme environments on Earth. The possibility of evaluating the occurrence of unknown or unexpected species, identifying redox gradients relevant to microbial metabolism, or testing for specific possible biosignatures, will play a key role in the future of space microbiology. In this review, we will examine the current and potential roles of lab-on-a-chip technology in space exploration and in extreme environment investigation, reporting what has been tested so far, and clarifying the direction toward which the newly developed technologies of portable lab-on-a-chip sensors are heading for exploration in extreme environments and in space.

Plant chemical genomics: gravity sensing and response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10386755/,"The first genome sequenced of a eukaryotic organism was for Saccharomyces cerevisiae , as reported in 1996, but it was more than 10 years before any of the zygomycete fungi, which are the early-diverging terrestrial fungi currently placed in the phyla Mucoromycota and Zoopagomycota , were sequenced. The genome for Rhizopus delemar was completed in 2008; currently, more than 1000 zygomycete genomes have been sequenced. Genomic data from these early-diverging terrestrial fungi revealed deep phylogenetic separation of the two major clades—primarily plant—associated saprotrophic and mycorrhizal Mucoromycota versus the primarily mycoparasitic or animal-associated parasites and commensals in the Zoopagomycota . Genomic studies provide many valuable insights into how these fungi evolved in response to the challenges of living on land, including adaptations to sensing light and gravity, development of hyphal growth, and co-existence with the first terrestrial plants. Genome sequence data have facilitated studies of genome architecture, including a history of genome duplications and horizontal gene transfer events, distribution and organization of mating type loci, rDNA genes and transposable elements, methylation processes, and genes useful for various industrial applications. Pathogenicity genes and specialized secondary metabolites have also been detected in soil saprobes and pathogenic fungi. Novel endosymbiotic bacteria and viruses have been discovered during several zygomycete genome projects. Overall, genomic information has helped to resolve a plethora of research questions, from the placement of zygomycetes on the evolutionary tree of life and in natural ecosystems, to the applied biotechnological and medical questions.

The interaction of vortical flows with red cells in venous valve mimics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8896891/,"The motion of cells orthogonal to the direction of main flow is of importance in natural and engineered systems. The lateral movement of red blood cells (RBCs) distal to sudden expansion is considered to influence the formation and progression of thrombosis in venous valves, aortic aneurysms, and blood-circulating devices and is also a determining parameter for cell separation applications in flow-focusing microfluidic devices. Although it is known that the unique geometry of venous valves alters the blood flow patterns and cell distribution in venous valve sinuses, the interactions between fluid flow and RBCs have not been elucidated. Here, using a dilute cell suspension in an in vitro microfluidic model of a venous valve, we quantified the spatial distribution of RBCs by microscopy and image analysis, and using micro-particle image velocimetry and 3D computational fluid dynamics simulations, we analyzed the complex flow patterns. The results show that the local hematocrit in the valve pockets is spatially heterogeneous and is significantly different from the feed hematocrit. Above a threshold shear rate, the inertial separation of streamlines and lift forces contribute to an uneven distribution of RBCs in the vortices, the entrapment of RBCs in the vortices, and non-monotonic wall shear stresses in the valve pockets. Our experimental and computational characterization provides insights into the complex interactions between fluid flow, RBC distribution, and wall shear rates in venous valve mimics, which is of relevance to understanding the pathophysiology of thrombosis and improving cell separation efficiency.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-biomicrofluid.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4916/8896891/6ffdc5527584/BIOMGB-000016-024103_1-g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4916/8896891/374f4220ef10/BIOMGB-000016-024103_1-g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4916/8896891/7d528182c5b1/BIOMGB-000016-024103_1-g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4916/8896891/3f348042247a/BIOMGB-000016-024103_1-g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4916/8896891/df1f507c0e2b/BIOMGB-000016-024103_1-g005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4916/8896891/c717061b4329/BIOMGB-000016-024103_1-g006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4916/8896891/848734645cc7/BIOMGB-000016-024103_1-g007.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4916/8896891/7382221de145/BIOMGB-000016-024103_1-g008.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Mammalian and Invertebrate Models as Complementary Tools for Gaining Mechanistic Insight on Muscle Responses to Spaceflight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8430797/,"Bioinformatics approaches have proven useful in understanding biological responses to spaceflight. Spaceflight experiments remain resource intensive and rare. One outstanding issue is how to maximize scientific output from a limited number of omics datasets from traditional animal models including nematodes, fruitfly, and rodents. The utility of omics data from invertebrate models in anticipating mammalian responses to spaceflight has not been fully explored. Hence, we performed comparative analyses of transcriptomes of soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) in mice that underwent 37 days of spaceflight. Results indicate shared stress responses and altered circadian rhythm. EDL showed more robust growth signals and Pde2a downregulation, possibly underlying its resistance to atrophy versus soleus. Spaceflight and hindlimb unloading mice shared differential regulation of proliferation, circadian, and neuronal signaling. Shared gene regulation in muscles of humans on bedrest and space flown rodents suggest targets for mitigating muscle atrophy in space and on Earth. Spaceflight responses of C. elegans were more similar to EDL. Discrete life stages of D. melanogaster have distinct utility in anticipating EDL and soleus responses. In summary, spaceflight leads to shared and discrete molecular responses between muscle types and invertebrate models may augment mechanistic knowledge gained from rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies.

Investigation of simulated microgravity effects on Streptococcus mutans physiology and global gene expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5460135/,"Astronauts have been previously shown to exhibit decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival inflammation in response to space flight, host factors that could contribute to oral diseases such as caries and periodontitis. However, the specific physiological response of caries-causing bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to space flight and/or ground-based simulated microgravity has not been extensively investigated. In this study, high aspect ratio vessel S. mutans simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures were assessed for changes in metabolite and transcriptome profiles, H 2 O 2 resistance, and competence in sucrose-containing biofilm media. Stationary phase S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased killing by H 2 O 2 compared to normal gravity control cultures, but competence was not affected. RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of 153 genes was up-regulated ≥2-fold and 94 genes down-regulated ≥2-fold during simulated microgravity high aspect ratio vessel growth. These included a number of genes located on extrachromosomal elements, as well as genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, translation, and stress responses. Collectively, these results suggest that growth under microgravity analog conditions promotes changes in S. mutans gene expression and physiology that may translate to an altered cariogenic potential of this organism during space flight missions.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-npjmicrogr.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8423/5460135/cda2ed846e6c/41526_2016_6_Fig1_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8423/5460135/5a75a3e7de10/41526_2016_6_Fig2_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8423/5460135/a88ff3b78b59/41526_2016_6_Fig3_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8423/5460135/2f0d1b2d0c85/41526_2016_6_Fig4_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8423/5460135/7b9561070602/41526_2016_6_Fig5_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/8423/5460135/765ca73bf957/41526_2016_6_Fig6_HTML.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Altered quorum sensing and physiology of Staphylococcus aureus during spaceflight detected by multi-omics data analysis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10774393/,"Staphylococcus aureus colonizes the nares of approximately 30% of humans, a risk factor for opportunistic infections. To gain insight into S. aureus virulence potential in the spaceflight environment, we analyzed RNA-Seq, cellular proteomics, and metabolomics data from the “Biological Research in Canisters-23” (BRIC-23) GeneLab spaceflight experiment, a mission designed to measure the response of S. aureus to growth in low earth orbit on the international space station. This experiment used Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) to grow asynchronous ground control and spaceflight cultures of S. aureus for 48 h. RNAIII, the effector of the Accessory Gene Regulator (Agr) quorum sensing system, was the most highly upregulated gene transcript in spaceflight relative to ground controls. The agr operon gene transcripts were also highly upregulated during spaceflight, followed by genes encoding phenol-soluble modulins and secreted proteases, which are positively regulated by Agr. Upregulated spaceflight genes/proteins also had functions related to urease activity, type VII-like Ess secretion, and copper transport. We also performed secretome analysis of BRIC-23 culture supernatants, which revealed that spaceflight samples had increased abundance of secreted virulence factors, including Agr-regulated proteases (SspA, SspB), staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc), and EsxA (secreted by the Ess system). These data also indicated that S. aureus metabolism is altered in spaceflight conditions relative to the ground controls. Collectively, these data suggest that S. aureus experiences increased quorum sensing and altered expression of virulence factors in response to the spaceflight environment that may impact its pathogenic potential.

Homotypic vacuole fusion requires VTI11 and is regulated by phosphoinositides,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6126739/,"The vacuole is an essential organelle in plant cells, and its dynamic nature is important for plant growth and development. Homotypic membrane fusion is required for vacuole biogenesis, pollen germination, stomata opening, and gravity perception. Known components of the vacuole fusion machinery in eukaryotes include SNARE proteins, Rab GTPases, phosphoinositides, and the homotypic fusion and vacuolar protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex. HOPS function is not well characterized in plants, but roles in embryogenesis and pollen tube elongation have been reported. Here, we show that Arabidopsis HOPS subunits VPS33 and VPS41 accumulate in late endosomes and that VPS41, but not VPS33, accumulates in the tonoplast via a wortmannin-sensitive process. VPS41 and VPS33 proteins bind to liposomes, but this binding is inhibited by phosphatidylinosiltol-3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and PtdIns(3,5)P 2 , which implicates a nonconserved mechanism for HOPS recruitment in plants. Inducible knockdown of VPS41 resulted in dramatic vacuole fragmentation phenotypes and demonstrated a critical role for HOPS in vacuole fusion. Furthermore, we provide evidence for genetic interactions between VPS41 and VTI11 SNARE that regulate vacuole fusion, and the requirement of a functional SNARE complex for normal VPS41 and VPS33 localization. Finally, we provide evidence to support VPS33 and SYP22 at the initial stage for HOPS–SNARE interactions, which is similar to other eukaryotes. These results highlight both conserved and specific mechanisms for HOPS recruitment and function during vacuole fusion in plants.
The plant vacuole is an essential organelle with multiple roles including storage, pH homeostasis, and recycling ( 1 ). Vacuole fusion is required for stomata opening, pollen fertility, and embryo viability ( 2 – 4 ). Two types of vacuoles exist in plant cells. Embryos in developing seeds contain multiple protein storage vacuoles (PSVs), which have a neutral pH and accumulate storage proteins such as the 7S and 11S globulins. Cells in most mature tissues, instead, contain one large lytic vacuole, which is acidic, abundant in lytic proteases, and critical for ion homeostasis and cell turgor ( 5 ). Transition from PSVs to lytic vacuoles occurs during germination ( 6 ) and involves PSV fusion and maturation ( 7 ). Vacuoles in root meristematic cells are formed by interconnected tubular structures ( 8 ), and membrane fusion is necessary for the establishment of the central lytic vacuole ( 2 ). Transient and mobile structures such as transvacuolar strands, sheets, and bulbs contribute to the dynamic nature of plant vacuoles ( 9 – 12 ). In vegetative cells, however, very little vacuole fragmentation occurs and most cells contain a single large vacuole. Two exceptions are the changes in guard cell vacuoles during stomata movements ( 2 , 13 , 14 ) and in the leaf motor cells of the mimosa tree ( Albizia julibrissin ) ( 15 ). In both cases, vacuole remodeling occurs during dramatic changes in cellular turgor that drive organ movements. The changes in guard cell vacuoles that occur during stomata opening require homotypic membrane fusion mediated by the vacuolar soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex containing VTI11 ( 2 ).
Vacuole fusion is not well characterized in plants, but in eukaryotic cells it requires SNAREs, RAB GTPases, membrane lipids, and a tethering complex. SNARE proteins mediate membrane fusion by assembly of a four-helix bundle, or trans -SNARE complex, from one SNARE located in the incoming vesicle and three SNAREs located in the target membrane. The SNARE complex brings the two membranes together via a zippering mechanism that is thought to result in membrane fusion ( 16 ). A SNARE complex for plant prevacuolar compartments (PVCs) and the vacuole is composed of SYP22/VAM3 (Qa-SNARE), VTI11 (Qb-SNARE, called Vti1p in yeast), SYP51 (Qc-SNARE), and VAMP727 (R-SNARE) ( 17 , 18 ). The Qabc complex can also associate with the R-SNAREs VAMP711 or VAMP713 ( 19 , 20 ). A role of these SNAREs in vacuole fusion is evidenced by altered vacuole phenotypes of vti11 , s yp22 , and syp22 vamp727 double mutants ( 2 , 18 , 21 ).
The homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex was recently shown to mediate homotypic vacuole fusion in plants ( 3 ). HOPS is important for the fusion of vacuoles in yeast ( 16 , 22 ), and fusion of lysosomes in Caenorhabditis elegans ( 23 ) and humans ( 24 ). The yeast HOPS complex is the best characterized and is formed by six subunits. Vps39p and Vps41p are HOPS specific, while Vps11p, Vps16p, Vps18p, and Vps33p form the “CORE” and are shared with CORVET, a tethering complex that functions at the early endosome ( 25 , 26 ). HOPS recruitment to yeast vacuole membranes requires phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , two important regulatory lipids in vacuole fusion ( 27 ). Vps33 belongs to the family of Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins, which are implicated in assembly and regulation of SNARE complexes. SM proteins have a three-domain architecture, in which domains 1 and 3 form a cleft that accommodates the SNAREs ( 28 ). The X-ray structure of a fungal Vps33 bound to a single SNARE, together with in vitro fusion assays, suggests that VPS33 catalyzes SNARE complex assembly through a specific SNARE motif recognition ( 29 ). All other HOPS subunits are predicted to form a β-propeller at the N terminus and an α-solenoid at the C terminus ( 30 ). The complete HOPS complex has been detected in Arabidopsis by mass spectrometry ( 3 ), and all subunits are encoded in the Arabidopsis genome as single genes ( 31 ). VACUOLELESS1 ( VCL1 ), the homolog of yeast Vps16, VPS11 , VPS39 , and VPS41 are required for vacuole biogenesis and pollen development ( 3 , 4 , 32 – 35 ). VCL1 interacts with VPS33 and VPS11 and localizes to PVCs and the tonoplast ( 35 ). VPS18 and VPS39 were also localized to a subdomain of the tonoplast and to cytosolic organelles ( 3 ). The molecular mechanisms for HOPS function and regulation during vacuole fusion in plants are not well characterized.
The RAB5 and RAB7 GTPase families have been implicated in regulation of endosomes maturation and membrane fusion at the vacuole ( 36 ). RAB5 and RAB7 localize to partially overlapping endosome populations, with only RAB7 detected at the tonoplast ( 19 , 37 – 41 ). The current model is that the SAND-CCZ complex is a RAB5 effector, exerts GEF function on RAB7, and is necessary for the conversion of RAB5 to RAB7 in PVCs ( 42 – 44 ). Active RAB7 is required for vacuolar localization of HOPS subunits VPS18 and VPS39 ( 3 ).
Plant homotypic vacuole fusion is also regulated by phosphoinositides. Pollen grains defective in phosphatidylinositol 4-phophate 5-kinase 1 (PI5K1) and PI5K2 have larger vacuoles than the WT, which implicates PtdIns(4,5)P 2 in vacuole biogenesis ( 45 ). Depletion of PtdIns(3)P after wortmannin (Wm) treatment induces rapid vacuole membrane fusion in root and hypocotyl cells of vti11/zig1 mutants and in guard cells of WT ( 2 ). Wm treatment also induces the swelling of plant PVCs, which results in doughnut-shaped structures known as Wm bodies ( 46 ). These effects of Wm are due to its inhibitory action against phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( 47 ) and implicate PtdIns(3)P and other phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion in plants. Interestingly, these effects of Wm have not been observed in yeast or animal cells ( 48 , 49 ), suggesting the possibility of specific mechanisms for plant vacuole fusion.
Here, we characterized VPS41 and VPS33 using reverse genetics, fluorescently tagged proteins, and biochemical analyses. We show that VPS41 and VPS33 are important for pollen fertility and PSV maturation in embryos, and that VPS41 is required for homotypic vacuole fusion in developing seedlings. We demonstrate that both proteins localize to late endosomes, that only VPS41 is detected in the tonoplast, and that they interact with each other and with the vacuolar SNARE SYP22. The VPS41-GFP localization at the tonoplast, but not that at late endosomes, is Wm sensitive. In vitro lipid–protein binding assays show that while VPS33 and VPS41 bind to phosphoinositides on lipid strips, neither protein binds to PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P 2 -containing liposomes, even though they do bind to control liposomes. We speculate that specific affinities for membrane lipids together with membrane curvature are key regulatory mechanisms behind vacuole fusion events mediated by HOPS and SNAREs.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-pnas.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/28b2/6126739/f7c352f365b8/pnas.1807763115fig01.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/28b2/6126739/63eb1949a798/pnas.1807763115fig02.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/28b2/6126739/28e5edf76c99/pnas.1807763115fig03.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/28b2/6126739/b5ea62d82acb/pnas.1807763115fig04.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
REGULATOR OF BULB BIOGENESIS1 (RBB1) Is Involved in Vacuole Bulb Formation in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411111/,"Vacuoles are dynamic compartments with constant fluctuations and transient structures such as trans-vacuolar strands and bulbs. Bulbs are highly dynamic spherical structures inside vacuoles that are formed by multiple layers of membranes and are continuous with the main tonoplast. We recently carried out a screen for mutants with abnormal trafficking to the vacuole or aberrant vacuole morphology. We characterized regulator of bulb biogenesis1-1 ( rbb1-1 ), a mutant in Arabidopsis that contains increased numbers of bulbs when compared to the parental control. rbb1-1 mutants also contain fewer transvacuolar strands than the parental control, and we propose the hypothesis that the formation of transvacuolar strands and bulbs is functionally related. We propose that the bulbs may function transiently to accommodate membranes and proteins when transvacuolar strands fail to elongate. We show that RBB1 corresponds to a very large protein of unknown function that is specific to plants, is present in the cytosol, and may associate with cellular membranes. RBB1 is involved in the regulation of vacuole morphology and may be involved in the establishment or stability of trans-vacuolar strands and bulbs.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1845/4411111/a4e9d3622d25/pone.0125621.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1845/4411111/4673a8d08a9e/pone.0125621.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1845/4411111/79878dfe87df/pone.0125621.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1845/4411111/bede2006a7ed/pone.0125621.g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1845/4411111/29d412512cb6/pone.0125621.g005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1845/4411111/9825d8aedda5/pone.0125621.g006.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
"Phosphoinositides control the localization of HOPS subunit VPS41, which together with VPS33 mediates vacuole fusion in plants.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6126739/,"The vacuole is an essential organelle in plant cells, and its dynamic nature is important for plant growth and development. Homotypic membrane fusion is required for vacuole biogenesis, pollen germination, stomata opening, and gravity perception. Known components of the vacuole fusion machinery in eukaryotes include SNARE proteins, Rab GTPases, phosphoinositides, and the homotypic fusion and vacuolar protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex. HOPS function is not well characterized in plants, but roles in embryogenesis and pollen tube elongation have been reported. Here, we show that Arabidopsis HOPS subunits VPS33 and VPS41 accumulate in late endosomes and that VPS41, but not VPS33, accumulates in the tonoplast via a wortmannin-sensitive process. VPS41 and VPS33 proteins bind to liposomes, but this binding is inhibited by phosphatidylinosiltol-3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and PtdIns(3,5)P 2 , which implicates a nonconserved mechanism for HOPS recruitment in plants. Inducible knockdown of VPS41 resulted in dramatic vacuole fragmentation phenotypes and demonstrated a critical role for HOPS in vacuole fusion. Furthermore, we provide evidence for genetic interactions between VPS41 and VTI11 SNARE that regulate vacuole fusion, and the requirement of a functional SNARE complex for normal VPS41 and VPS33 localization. Finally, we provide evidence to support VPS33 and SYP22 at the initial stage for HOPS–SNARE interactions, which is similar to other eukaryotes. These results highlight both conserved and specific mechanisms for HOPS recruitment and function during vacuole fusion in plants.
The plant vacuole is an essential organelle with multiple roles including storage, pH homeostasis, and recycling ( 1 ). Vacuole fusion is required for stomata opening, pollen fertility, and embryo viability ( 2 – 4 ). Two types of vacuoles exist in plant cells. Embryos in developing seeds contain multiple protein storage vacuoles (PSVs), which have a neutral pH and accumulate storage proteins such as the 7S and 11S globulins. Cells in most mature tissues, instead, contain one large lytic vacuole, which is acidic, abundant in lytic proteases, and critical for ion homeostasis and cell turgor ( 5 ). Transition from PSVs to lytic vacuoles occurs during germination ( 6 ) and involves PSV fusion and maturation ( 7 ). Vacuoles in root meristematic cells are formed by interconnected tubular structures ( 8 ), and membrane fusion is necessary for the establishment of the central lytic vacuole ( 2 ). Transient and mobile structures such as transvacuolar strands, sheets, and bulbs contribute to the dynamic nature of plant vacuoles ( 9 – 12 ). In vegetative cells, however, very little vacuole fragmentation occurs and most cells contain a single large vacuole. Two exceptions are the changes in guard cell vacuoles during stomata movements ( 2 , 13 , 14 ) and in the leaf motor cells of the mimosa tree ( Albizia julibrissin ) ( 15 ). In both cases, vacuole remodeling occurs during dramatic changes in cellular turgor that drive organ movements. The changes in guard cell vacuoles that occur during stomata opening require homotypic membrane fusion mediated by the vacuolar soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex containing VTI11 ( 2 ).
Vacuole fusion is not well characterized in plants, but in eukaryotic cells it requires SNAREs, RAB GTPases, membrane lipids, and a tethering complex. SNARE proteins mediate membrane fusion by assembly of a four-helix bundle, or trans -SNARE complex, from one SNARE located in the incoming vesicle and three SNAREs located in the target membrane. The SNARE complex brings the two membranes together via a zippering mechanism that is thought to result in membrane fusion ( 16 ). A SNARE complex for plant prevacuolar compartments (PVCs) and the vacuole is composed of SYP22/VAM3 (Qa-SNARE), VTI11 (Qb-SNARE, called Vti1p in yeast), SYP51 (Qc-SNARE), and VAMP727 (R-SNARE) ( 17 , 18 ). The Qabc complex can also associate with the R-SNAREs VAMP711 or VAMP713 ( 19 , 20 ). A role of these SNAREs in vacuole fusion is evidenced by altered vacuole phenotypes of vti11 , s yp22 , and syp22 vamp727 double mutants ( 2 , 18 , 21 ).
The homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex was recently shown to mediate homotypic vacuole fusion in plants ( 3 ). HOPS is important for the fusion of vacuoles in yeast ( 16 , 22 ), and fusion of lysosomes in Caenorhabditis elegans ( 23 ) and humans ( 24 ). The yeast HOPS complex is the best characterized and is formed by six subunits. Vps39p and Vps41p are HOPS specific, while Vps11p, Vps16p, Vps18p, and Vps33p form the “CORE” and are shared with CORVET, a tethering complex that functions at the early endosome ( 25 , 26 ). HOPS recruitment to yeast vacuole membranes requires phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , two important regulatory lipids in vacuole fusion ( 27 ). Vps33 belongs to the family of Sec1/Munc18 (SM) proteins, which are implicated in assembly and regulation of SNARE complexes. SM proteins have a three-domain architecture, in which domains 1 and 3 form a cleft that accommodates the SNAREs ( 28 ). The X-ray structure of a fungal Vps33 bound to a single SNARE, together with in vitro fusion assays, suggests that VPS33 catalyzes SNARE complex assembly through a specific SNARE motif recognition ( 29 ). All other HOPS subunits are predicted to form a β-propeller at the N terminus and an α-solenoid at the C terminus ( 30 ). The complete HOPS complex has been detected in Arabidopsis by mass spectrometry ( 3 ), and all subunits are encoded in the Arabidopsis genome as single genes ( 31 ). VACUOLELESS1 ( VCL1 ), the homolog of yeast Vps16, VPS11 , VPS39 , and VPS41 are required for vacuole biogenesis and pollen development ( 3 , 4 , 32 – 35 ). VCL1 interacts with VPS33 and VPS11 and localizes to PVCs and the tonoplast ( 35 ). VPS18 and VPS39 were also localized to a subdomain of the tonoplast and to cytosolic organelles ( 3 ). The molecular mechanisms for HOPS function and regulation during vacuole fusion in plants are not well characterized.
The RAB5 and RAB7 GTPase families have been implicated in regulation of endosomes maturation and membrane fusion at the vacuole ( 36 ). RAB5 and RAB7 localize to partially overlapping endosome populations, with only RAB7 detected at the tonoplast ( 19 , 37 – 41 ). The current model is that the SAND-CCZ complex is a RAB5 effector, exerts GEF function on RAB7, and is necessary for the conversion of RAB5 to RAB7 in PVCs ( 42 – 44 ). Active RAB7 is required for vacuolar localization of HOPS subunits VPS18 and VPS39 ( 3 ).
Plant homotypic vacuole fusion is also regulated by phosphoinositides. Pollen grains defective in phosphatidylinositol 4-phophate 5-kinase 1 (PI5K1) and PI5K2 have larger vacuoles than the WT, which implicates PtdIns(4,5)P 2 in vacuole biogenesis ( 45 ). Depletion of PtdIns(3)P after wortmannin (Wm) treatment induces rapid vacuole membrane fusion in root and hypocotyl cells of vti11/zig1 mutants and in guard cells of WT ( 2 ). Wm treatment also induces the swelling of plant PVCs, which results in doughnut-shaped structures known as Wm bodies ( 46 ). These effects of Wm are due to its inhibitory action against phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( 47 ) and implicate PtdIns(3)P and other phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion in plants. Interestingly, these effects of Wm have not been observed in yeast or animal cells ( 48 , 49 ), suggesting the possibility of specific mechanisms for plant vacuole fusion.
Here, we characterized VPS41 and VPS33 using reverse genetics, fluorescently tagged proteins, and biochemical analyses. We show that VPS41 and VPS33 are important for pollen fertility and PSV maturation in embryos, and that VPS41 is required for homotypic vacuole fusion in developing seedlings. We demonstrate that both proteins localize to late endosomes, that only VPS41 is detected in the tonoplast, and that they interact with each other and with the vacuolar SNARE SYP22. The VPS41-GFP localization at the tonoplast, but not that at late endosomes, is Wm sensitive. In vitro lipid–protein binding assays show that while VPS33 and VPS41 bind to phosphoinositides on lipid strips, neither protein binds to PtdIns(3)P or PtdIns(3,5)P 2 -containing liposomes, even though they do bind to control liposomes.

Microgravity enhances the phenotype of Arabidopsis zigzag-1 and reduces the Wortmannin-induced vacuole fusion in root cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9445043/,"The spaceflight environment of the International Space Station poses a multitude of stresses on plant growth including reduced gravity. Plants exposed to microgravity and other conditions on the ISS display root skewing, changes in gene expression and protein abundance that may result in changes in cell wall composition, antioxidant accumulation and modification of growth anisotropy. Systematic studies that address the effects of microgravity on cellular organelles are lacking but altered numbers and sizes of vacuoles have been detected in previous flights. The prominent size of plant vacuoles makes them ideal models to study organelle dynamics in space. Here, we used Arabidopsis zigzag-1 ( zig-1 ) as a sensitized genotype to study the effect of microgravity on plant vacuole fusion. Wortmannin was used to induce vacuole fusion in seedlings and a formaldehyde-based fixation protocol was developed to visualize plant vacuole morphology after sample return, using confocal microscopy. Our results indicate that microgravity enhances the zig-1 phenotype by reducing hypocotyl growth and vacuole fusion in some cells. This study demonstrates the feasibility of chemical inhibitor treatments for plant cell biology experiments in space.

Intrauterine exposure to maternal stress alters Bdnf IV DNA methylation and telomere length in the brain of adult rat offspring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5600826/,"DNA methylation (addition of methyl groups to cytosines) and changes in telomere length (TTAGGG repeats on the ends of chromosomes) are two molecular modifications that result from stress and could contribute to the long-term effects of intrauterine exposure to maternal stress on offspring behavior. Here, we measured methylation of DNA associated with the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene, a gene important in development and plasticity, and telomere length in the brains of adult rat male and female offspring whose mothers were exposed to unpredictable and variable stressors throughout gestation. Males exposed to prenatal stress had greater methylation ( Bdnf IV ) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) compared to non-stressed male controls and stressed females. Further, prenatally-stressed animals had shorter telomeres than controls in the mPFC. Together findings indicate a long-term impact of prenatal stress on brain DNA methylation and telomere biology with relevance for behavioral and health outcomes, and contribute to a growing literature linking stress to intergenerational molecular changes.

Brassinazole resistant 1 (BZR1)-dependent brassinosteroid signalling pathway leads to ectopic activation of quiescent cell division and suppresses columella stem cell differentiation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4507784/,"Previous publications have shown that BRI1 EMS suppressor 1 (BES1), a positive regulator of the brassinosteroid (BR) signalling pathway, enhances cell divisions in the quiescent centre (QC) and stimulates columella stem cell differentiation. Here, it is demonstrated that BZR1, a BES1 homologue, also promotes cell divisions in the QC, but it suppresses columella stem cell differentiation, opposite to the action of BES1. In addition, BR and its BZR1-mediated signalling pathway are shown to alter the expression/subcellular distribution of pin-formed (PINs), which may result in changes in auxin movement. BR promotes intense nuclear accumulation of BZR1 in the root tip area, and the binding of BZR1 to the promoters of several root development-regulating genes, modulating their expression in the root stem cell niche area. These BZR1-mediated signalling cascades may account for both the ectopic activation of QC cell divisions as well as the suppression of the columella stem cell differentiation. They could also inhibit auxin-dependent distal stem cell differentiation by antagonizing the auxin/WOX5-dependent pathway. In conclusion, BZR1-/BES1-mediated BR signalling pathways show differential effects on the maintenance of root apical meristem activities: they stimulate ectopic QC division while they show opposite effects on the differentiation of distal columella stem cells in a BR concentration- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent manner.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-jexbot.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e602/4507784/be193eea0fa0/exbotj_erv316_f0001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e602/4507784/08364d9a4be9/exbotj_erv316_f0005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e602/4507784/6b31c85fdfe1/exbotj_erv316_f0002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e602/4507784/c3fbd6321b11/exbotj_erv316_f0004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e602/4507784/c1d0fc999eb9/exbotj_erv316_f0006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e602/4507784/492be5e35e17/exbotj_erv316_f0003.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Proteomic study of microsomal proteins reveals a key role for Arabidopsis Annexin 1 in mediating heat stress-induced increase in intracellular calcium levels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4349987/,"To understand the early signaling steps in the response of plant cells to increased environmental temperature, 2-D difference gel electrophoresis was used to study the proteins in microsomes of Arabidopsis seedlings that are regulated early during heat stress. Using mass spectrometry, 19 microsomal proteins that showed an altered expression level within 5 min after heat treatment were identified. Among these proteins, annexin 1 (AtANN1) was one of those up-regulated rapidly after heat-shock treatment. Functional studies show loss-of-function mutants for AtANN1 and its close homolog AtANN2 were more sensitive to heat-shock treatment, whereas plants overexpressing AtANN1 showed more resistance to this treatment. Correspondingly, the heat-induced expression of heat-shock proteins and heat-shock factors is inhibited in ann1/ann2 double mutant, and the heat-activated increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca 2+ ] cyt ) is greatly impaired in the ann1 mutant and almost undetectable in ann1/ann2 double mutant. Taken together these results suggest that AtANN1 is important in regulating the heat-induced increase in [Ca 2+ ] cyt and in the response of Arabidopsis seedlings to heat stress.
Temperatures above the optimum are sensed as heat stress (HS) 1 by all living organisms. When exposed to high temperature, plants have sophisticated mechanisms to maintain cellular homeostasis and minimize cell damage. Heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) mediate gene expression changes leading to the production of heat shock proteins (HSPs) that confer thermotolerance to plants ( 1 , 2 , 3 ). In recent years, there has been considerable progress in identifying the signaling steps that enable plants to respond to heat stress at the molecular level. These include: activation of bZIP transcription factors by heat-induced proteolytic cleavage ( 4 ); inhibition of transgene-induced post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) by SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 (SGS3) ( 5 ); accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by RBOHD activation ( 6 ); and reduced H2A.Z occupancy in nucleosomes of heat-regulated genes, which would be expected to stimulate transcription of these genes ( 7 ).
Many reports also provide evidence that membrane-localized calcium channels can act as sensors for increased temperature in plant cells ( 8 , 9 ). The increase in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca 2+ ] cyt ) caused by calcium influx from the extracellular matrix is an early critical step in the HS signal transduction pathway ( 10 ). In responding to this calcium influx, calcium-binding proteins such as calmodulin and calcium dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are activated. Calmodulin binds to a calmodulin-binding protein kinase, which in turn, activates heat-regulated changes in gene expression by phosphorylating HSF ( 11 , 12 , 13 ). CDPKs, on the other hand, might regulate plant heat-shock responses by activating multiple mitogen-activated protein kinases ( 14 ).
Despite considerable progress in studying the mechanisms of heat-shock signal transduction, our understanding of the heat signal perception and early signaling transduction mechanism is still very limited. Therefore, identifying novel proteins that regulate early heat-shock responses should help decoding high-temperature sensing and responding mechanism in planta . Along with advances in genome sequencing, new proteomic technologies have now emerged as an important tool in studying signal transduction mechanisms ( 15 ). Compared with traditional genetic studies, which rely on phenotypes caused by altering gene activity, proteomics not only provides real-time monitoring of abundance changes of certain proteins during cell and tissue responses to stimuli, but also reveals their mechanisms of function and regulation, such as post-translational modifications and protein–protein interaction. In this study, we used the two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) technology to find microsome-associated proteins whose level changes rapidly after heat-shock, and identified a set of membrane proteins that change abundance in response to a five-minute heat treatment. Among these proteins was annexin 1 (AtANN1), and here we demonstrate that this protein plays a key role in plant heat-stress responses by mediating a heat-induced increase in [Ca 2+ ] cyt .","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-mcp.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4700/4349987/f3fad4428d58/zjw0031549870001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4700/4349987/d394d9a9eee2/zjw0031549870002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4700/4349987/89aa42c33909/zjw0031549870003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4700/4349987/20c53c7f3e29/zjw0031549870004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4700/4349987/0f3b46df19ec/zjw0031549870005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4700/4349987/a334bada4c56/zjw0031549870006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4700/4349987/1f64699c2b72/zjw0031549870007.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

ANN1 and ANN2 Function in Post-Phloem Sugar Transport in Root Tips to Affect Primary Root Growth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6130020/,"Annexins are a multigene family of calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins that play important roles in plant cell signaling. Annexins are multifunctional proteins, and their function in plants is not comprehensively understood. Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) annexins ANN1 and ANN2 are 64% identical in their primary structure, and both are highly expressed in seedlings. Here, we showed that ann-mutant seedlings grown in the absence of sugar show decreased primary root growth and altered columella cells in root caps; however, these mutant defects are rescued by Suc, Glc, or Fru. In seedlings grown without sugar, significant up-regulation of photosynthetic gene expression and chlorophyll accumulation was found in ann-mutant cotyledons compared to that in wild type, which indicates potential sugar starvation in the roots of ann-mutant seedlings. Unexpectedly, the overall sugar content of ann-mutant primary roots was significantly higher than that of wild-type roots when grown without sugar. To examine the diffusion of sugar along the entire root to the root tip, we examined the unloading pattern of carboxyfluorescein dye and found that post-phloem sugar transport was impaired in ann-mutant root tips compared to that in wild type. Increased levels of ROS and callose were detected in the root tips of ann-mutant seedlings grown without Suc, the latter of which would restrict plasmodesmal sugar transport to root tips. Our results indicate that ANN1 and ANN2 play an important role in post-phloem sugar transport to the root tip, which in turn indirectly influences photosynthetic rates in cotyledons. This study expands our understanding of the function of annexins in plants.
Annexins are multifunctional proteins that have been found in all plants and vertebrate species. Their tertiary structure with calcium-binding domains is evolutionarily conserved in all species ( Morgan et al., 2004 , 2006 ; Konopka-Postupolska et al., 2011 ; Clark et al., 2012 ). In plants, annexins have been localized in many parts of the cell, including the plasma membrane, the Golgi apparatus, secretory vesicles, vacuolar membranes, and the nucleus. Certain annexins are also found in the extracellular matrix as secreted proteins.
On the molecular level, certain plant annexins serve as components of calcium channels or regulate calcium channel activity to help initiate and amplify calcium signals in plants ( Laohavisit et al., 2010 ; Laohavisit and Davies, 2011 ; Davies, 2014 ). On the cellular level, one of the earliest functions discovered for annexins in plant cells was meditation of vesicle trafficking and secretion ( Konopka-Postupolska and Clark, 2017 ). On the whole-plant level, key discoveries of annexin function have been carried out using mutants of the model plant, Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ), where there are eight different annexins that show differential expression patterns ( Cantero et al., 2006 ). Several of these mutant studies show that certain Arabidopsis annexins function to provide stress tolerance in response to a variety of stress conditions ( Konopka-Postupolska et al., 2009 ; Dalal et al., 2014 ; Richards et al., 2014 ; Wang et al., 2015 ; Liao et al., 2017 ). For example, overexpression of ANN1 in Arabidopsis results in increased antioxidant activity and confers drought tolerance ( Konopka-Postupolska et al., 2009 ).
Plant annexins are expressed in all stages of plant growth and development. Recently, Thieme et al. (2015) found that some Arabidopsis annexin transcripts can be transported across the whole plant by phloem sap. Annexin proteins have also been identified in the phloem sap of several different plant species ( Kehr, 2006 ), and in Arabidopsis, ANN1 was found in phloem exudate of rosette leaves ( Guelette et al., 2012 ). Immunolocalization of a pea annexin protein in young developing sieve elements led to the suggestion that annexins may play a role in phloem cell development ( Clark et al., 1992 ). In situ transcript localization studies found that ANN1 is expressed in phloem and phloem parenchyma in Arabidopsis seedlings ( Clark et al., 2001 ). However, the physiological importance of annexins in phloem remains undefined.
Phloem transport links sources to sinks and is a key passageway for communication between leaves and roots. Sugars generated from photosynthetic leaves (source organs) and transported through the phloem to roots (sink organs) serve both as metabolic substrates to fuel plant growth and development and as signals that integrate plant responses to environmental stimuli, hormones, and changes in nutrition status ( Martin et al., 2002 ; Moore et al., 2003 ; Smeekens et al., 2010 ; Lastdrager et al., 2014 ; Ljung et al., 2015 ; Dobrenel et al., 2016 ; Dodds and Lagudah, 2016 ; Kühn, 2016 ; Li and Sheen, 2016 ; Baena-González and Hanson, 2017 ). Plants have developed complex sugar-sensing systems to monitor and respond to continuous fluctuations in sugar status caused by the circadian clock and frequent environmental changes ( Stitt and Zeeman, 2012 ).
Multiple recent studies have revealed significant roles of sugar in plant growth ( Lastdrager et al., 2014 ) and development ( Wingler, 2018 ). For example, sugar availability to axillary buds is a key determinant for shoot branching. Removal of pea shoot tips induces a sufficient flow of sugar into axillary buds to repress the expression of the branching inhibitor gene Branched1 , which highlights the importance of sugars in mediating apical dominance ( Mason et al., 2014 ). Sugars in photosynthetic leaves function as mobile signals to repress the expression of microRNA156 and thus promote the maturation of juvenile plants ( Yu et al., 2013 ).
Important sugar responses are also found in roots, whose growth depends on Suc transported from photosynthetic leaves. This dependence underscores the importance of understanding the effects of sugars on root growth and development. Although sugar controls primary and lateral root growth in a dose-dependent manner ( Freixes et al., 2002 ), sugar demand in roots continuously changes due to environmental signals ( Lemoine et al., 2013 ) and developmental stages. Having a sugar-sensing system in roots that can efficiently monitor sugar levels would be important for root and whole-plant growth. However, studies of sugar signaling in roots are generally scant.
Root growth is closely associated with sugar concentrations ( Thompson et al., 2017 ). Greater soluble sugar content has been found in fast-growing roots of pruned barley plants, whereas slow-growing barley roots contain less soluble sugar ( Farrar and Jones, 1986 ). Suc generated by photosynthesis in cotyledons is required to regulate primary root growth ( Kircher and Schopfer, 2012 ). Suc promotes primary root elongation in a dose-dependent manner. The higher the exogenous Suc concentration, the faster primary roots elongate ( Freixes et al., 2002 ). Furthermore, the finding that neighboring secondary roots in the same root system have different growth rates in their elongation zone as a function of local sugar concentration also favors the conclusion that sugar is a major determinant of root growth ( Freixes et al., 2002 ).
Because local sugar concentrations play critical roles in regulating root growth, it is important to learn more about the mechanisms that control sugar transport into the growing zones of the root. Sugars generated by photosynthesis in leaves are loaded into sieve elements of the phloem and then delivered by phloem into roots ( De Schepper et al., 2013 ). According to pressure flow theory, it is the osmotic differential in phloem sieve elements that drives the bulk flow from source photosynthetic organs to sink organs such as roots. After sugar reaches its destination, it must be unloaded from phloem sieve elements into surrounding cells. Ross-Elliott et al. (2017) have proposed that after sugar reaches the connecting tissue between conducting phloem and sink tissues, called protophloem, it is unloaded into surrounding cells through funnel plasmodesmata and then diffuses freely along a concentration gradient into cells of the root tip in a symplastic way. The unloading of sugar into the elongation zone, mitotic zone, and root cap accommodates the high-energy demands of fast-growing regions in roots. Here, we describe the effect of knocking out two of the eight members of the annexin gene family in Arabidopsis, namely ANN1 and ANN2 , on the diffusion of sugars from the unloading zone to root tips, and we discuss how these two annexins play an important mechanistic role in post-phloem transport of sugars into root tips.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plntphys.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1b9f/6130020/9a2a451998fb/PP_201800713DR1_f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1b9f/6130020/6e7368bdfa3b/PP_201800713DR1_f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1b9f/6130020/cc753ec390c2/PP_201800713DR1_f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1b9f/6130020/ab3464e1a9d7/PP_201800713DR1_f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1b9f/6130020/72ee4c213609/PP_201800713DR1_f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1b9f/6130020/49a39c9be6b8/PP_201800713DR1_f6.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1b9f/6130020/2abf3461d853/PP_201800713DR1_f7.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Mitochondria-targeted human catalase in the mouse longevity MCAT model mitigates head-tilt bedrest-induced neuro-inflammation in the hippocampus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9695374/,"Microgravity (modeled by head-tilt bedrest and hind-limb unloading), experienced during prolonged spaceflight, results in neurological consequences, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, and potentially impairment during the performance of critical tasks. Similar pathologies are observed in bedrest, sedentary lifestyle, and muscle disuse on Earth. In our previous study, we saw that head-tilt bedrest together with social isolation upregulated the milieu of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and plasma. These changes were mitigated in a MCAT mouse model overexpressing human catalase in the mitochondria, pointing out the importance of ROS signaling in this stress response. Here, we used a head-tilt model in socially housed mice to tease out the effects of head-tilt bedrest without isolation. In order to find the underlying molecular mechanisms that provoked the cytokine response, we measured CD68, an indicator of microglial activation in the hippocampus, as well as changes in normal in-cage behavior. We hypothesized that hindlimb unloading (HU) will elicit microglial hippocampal activations, which will be mitigated in the MCAT ROS-quenching mice model. Indeed, we saw an elevation of the activated microglia CD68 marker following HU in the hippocampus, and this pathology was mitigated in MCAT mice. Additionally, we identified cytokines in the hippocampus, which had significant positive correlations with CD68 and negative correlations with exploratory behaviors, indicating a link between neuroinflammation and behavioral consequences. Unveiling a correlation between molecular and behavioral changes could reveal a biomarker indicative of these responses and could also result in a potential target for the treatment and prevention of cognitive changes following long space missions and/or muscle disuse on Earth.

Structural and functional properties of bone are compromised in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6141014/,"In addition to muscle weakness, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is associated with an increased incidence of skeletal fractures. The SOD1 G93A mouse model recapitulates many features of human ALS. These mice also exhibit decreased bone mass. However, the functional, or biomechanical, behavior of the skeleton in SOD1 G93A mice has not been investigated. To do so, we examined skeletal phenotypes in end-stage (16-week-old) SOD1 G93A female mice and healthy littermate female controls (N=9–10/group). Outcomes included trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture by microcomputed tomography; stiffness and strength via three-point bending; resistance to crack growth by fracture toughness testing; and cortical bone matrix properties via cyclic reference point indentation.
SOD1 G93A mice had similar bone size, but significantly lower trabecular bone mass (−54%), thinner trabeculae (−41%) and decreased cortical bone thickness (−17%) and cortical area (−18%) compared to control mice (all p<0.01). In line with these bone mass and microstructure deficits, SOD1 G93A mice had significantly lower femoral bending stiffness (−27%) and failure moment (−41%), along with decreased fracture toughness (−18%) (all p<0.001).
This is the first study to demonstrate functional deficits in the skeleton of end-stage ALS mice, and imply multiple mechanisms for increased skeletal fragility and fracture risk in patients in ALS. Importantly, our results provide strong rationale for interventions to reduce fracture risk in ALS patients with advanced disease.

Longitudinal time course of muscle impairments during partial weight-bearing in rats,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6706399/,"In the near future, space agencies plan to send the first crews for extended stays on the Moon and Mars, where gravity is significantly reduced compared to Earth (0.16× g and 0.38× g , respectively). However, the long-term effects of partial gravity have not yet been elucidated, and ensuring astronauts’ health and performance is crucial to the success of these missions. Using a quadrupedal partial weight-bearing (PWB) model in rats that we designed, we investigated the longitudinal time course of muscle function at three different PWB levels. We demonstrated that both muscle mass and muscle function are significantly impaired in reduced weight-bearing environments as early as after 7 days of suspension. Moreover, we showed that muscular alterations are correlated to the PWB level and do not reach a plateau during a 1-month exposure to reduced weight-bearing, emphasizing the need for mitigating countermeasures for safe and successful extraterrestrial exploration.

Dose-dependent skeletal deficits due to varied reductions in mechanical loading in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7235020/,"Reduced skeletal loading leads to marked bone loss. Animal models of hindlimb suspension are widely used to assess alterations in skeleton during the course of complete unloading. More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the musculoskeletal system have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks ( n = 11–12/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deficits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on cortical bone.

Approaching Gravity as a Continuum Using the Rat Partial Weight-Bearing Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7599661/,"For decades, scientists have relied on animals to understand the risks and consequences of space travel. Animals remain key to study the physiological alterations during spaceflight and provide crucial information about microgravity-induced changes. While spaceflights may appear common, they remain costly and, coupled with limited cargo areas, do not allow for large sample sizes onboard. In 1979, a model of hindlimb unloading (HU) was successfully created to mimic microgravity and has been used extensively since its creation. Four decades later, the first model of mouse partial weight-bearing (PWB) was developed, aiming at mimicking partial gravity environments. Return to the Lunar surface for astronauts is now imminent and prompted the need for an animal model closer to human physiology; hence in 2018, our laboratory created a new model of PWB for adult rats. In this review, we will focus on the rat model of PWB, from its conception to the current state of knowledge. Additionally, we will address how this new model, used in conjunction with HU, will help implement new paradigms allowing scientists to anticipate the physiological alterations and needs of astronauts. Finally, we will discuss the outstanding questions and future perspectives in space research and propose potential solutions using the rat PWB model.

Hindlimb suspension in Wistar rats: Sex-based differences in muscle response,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8493566/,"Ground‐based animal models have been used extensively to understand the effects of microgravity on various physiological systems. Among them, hindlimb suspension (HLS), developed in 1979 in rats, remains the gold‐standard and allows researchers to study the consequences of total unloading of the hind limbs while inducing a cephalic fluid shift. While this model has already brought valuable insights to space biology, few studies have directly compared functional decrements in the muscles of males and females during HLS. We exposed 28 adult Wistar rats (14 males and 14 females) to 14 days of HLS or normal loading (NL) to better assess how sex impacts disuse‐induced muscle deconditioning. Females better maintained muscle function during HLS than males, as shown by a more moderate reduction in grip strength at 7 days (males: −37.5 ± 3.1%, females: −22.4 ± 6.5%, compared to baseline), that remains stable during the second week of unloading (males: −53.3 ± 5.7%, females: −22.4 ± 5.5%, compared to day 0) while the males exhibit a steady decrease over time (effect of sex × loading p = 0.0002, effect of sex × time × loading p = 0.0099). This was further supported by analyzing the force production in response to a tetanic stimulus. Further functional analyses using force production were also shown to correspond to sex differences in relative loss of muscle mass and CSA. Moreover, our functional data were supported by histomorphometric analyzes, and we highlighted differences in relative muscle loss and CSA. Specifically, female rats seem to experience a lesser muscle deconditioning during disuse than males thus emphasizing the need for more studies that will assess male and female animals concomitantly to develop tailored, effective countermeasures for all astronauts.
Keywords: ground‐based, microgravity, muscle, sex‐based, spaceflight
Using the well‐established hindlimb suspension model in rats, we find females appear to have attenuated muscle decrements compared to males after 14 days of disuse. Specifically, females have attenuated decrements to muscle size, cross‐sectional area, and force productions compared to males. These results provide more nuances on the possible interactions between sexes during muscle atrophies and emphasize the importance of addressing sex‐based differences in research investigations, both on the ground and in space.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-physrep.gif"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4769/8493566/72e018b61293/PHY2-9-e15042-g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4769/8493566/f7170731b9c4/PHY2-9-e15042-g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4769/8493566/be135a1a331c/PHY2-9-e15042-g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4769/8493566/ea9391c2bcbc/PHY2-9-e15042-g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4769/8493566/25e80cefb3ad/PHY2-9-e15042-g005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/4769/8493566/cffeaa22d69d/PHY2-9-e15042-g006.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

Transcriptomic Signature of the Simulated Microgravity Response in Caenorhabditis elegans and Comparison to Spaceflight Experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9856674/,"Given the growing interest in human exploration of space, it is crucial to identify the effects of space conditions on biological processes. Here, we analyze the transcriptomic response of Caenorhabditis elegans to simulated microgravity and observe the maintained transcriptomic response after returning to ground conditions for four, eight, and twelve days. We show that 75% of the simulated microgravity-induced changes on gene expression persist after returning to ground conditions for four days while most of these changes are reverted after twelve days. Our results from integrative RNA-seq and mass spectrometry analyses suggest that simulated microgravity affects longevity-regulating insulin/IGF-1 and sphingolipid signaling pathways. Finally, we identified 118 genes that are commonly differentially expressed in simulated microgravity- and space-exposed worms. Overall, this work provides insight into the effect of microgravity on biological systems during and after exposure.

Enabling clonal analyses of yeast in outer space by encapsulation and desiccation in hollow microparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9410522/,"Studying microbes at the single-cell level in space can accelerate human space exploration both via the development of novel biotechnologies and via the understanding of cellular responses to space stressors and countermeasures. High-throughput technologies for screening natural and engineered cell populations can reveal cellular heterogeneity and identify high-performance cells. Here, we present a method to desiccate and preserve microbes in nanoliter-scale compartments, termed PicoShells, which are microparticles with a hollow inner cavity. In PicoShells, single cells are confined in an inner aqueous core by a porous hydrogel shell, allowing the diffusion of nutrients, wastes, and assay reagents for uninhibited cell growth and flexible assay protocols. Desiccated PicoShells offer analysis capabilities for single-cell derived colonies with a simple, low resource workflow, requiring only the addition of water to rehydrate hundreds of thousands of PicoShells and the single microbes encapsulated inside. Our desiccation method results in the recovery of desiccated microparticle morphology and porosity after a multi-week storage period and rehydration, with particle diameter and porosity metrics changing by less than 18% and 7%, respectively, compared to fresh microparticles. We also recorded the high viability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast desiccated and rehydrated inside PicoShells, with only a 14% decrease in viability compared to non-desiccated yeast over 8.5 weeks, although we observed an 85% decrease in initial growth potential over the same duration. We show a proof-of-concept for a growth rate-based analysis of single-cell derived colonies in rehydrated PicoShells, where we identified 11% of the population that grows at an accelerated rate. Desiccated PicoShells thus provide a robust method for cell preservation before and during launch, promising a simple single-cell analysis method for studying heterogeneity in microbial populations in space.

Dried plum diet protects from bone loss caused by ionizing radiation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4750446/,"Bone loss caused by ionizing radiation is a potential health concern for radiotherapy patients, radiation workers and astronauts. In animal studies, exposure to ionizing radiation increases oxidative damage in skeletal tissues, and results in an imbalance in bone remodeling initiated by increased bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Therefore, we evaluated various candidate interventions with antioxidant or anti-inflammatory activities (antioxidant cocktail, dihydrolipoic acid, ibuprofen, dried plum) both for their ability to blunt the expression of resorption-related genes in marrow cells after irradiation with either gamma rays (photons, 2 Gy) or simulated space radiation (protons and heavy ions, 1 Gy) and to prevent bone loss. Dried plum was most effective in reducing the expression of genes related to bone resorption ( Nfe2l2, Rankl, Mcp1, Opg, TNF-α ) and also preventing later cancellous bone decrements caused by irradiation with either photons or heavy ions. Thus, dietary supplementation with DP may prevent the skeletal effects of radiation exposures either in space or on Earth.
Radiation exposure of skeletal tissues can lead to bone loss and therefore is relevant to astronauts 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , radiation workers and victims of nuclear accidents 14 , 15 , 16 . Reduced bone density (osteopenia) and osteoporosis, are major health conditions affecting millions of people across the world, and osteoporotic patients are increasing with an aging population 17 . Extensive research focuses on both understanding the fundamental underlying mechanisms and finding suitable treatments for such patients. However, major health concerns remain, such as secondary drug effects, osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fractures 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , motivating continued search for osteoprotective treatments against bone loss.
Space radiation is a unique type of radiation, composed of various ions and photons due to the combination of galactic cosmic rays (GCR), solar particle events (SPE), and protons and electrons trapped in the magnetosphere 22 , 23 . Linear energy transfer (LET) of a given ion species reflects its ionization capacity and the heavier the nuclei (High-Z High-Energy, HZE), the more primary and secondary ionizations occur for each particle traversal 22 , 23 . Galactic space radiation is composed of mostly low-LET species including proton ( 1 H, 87%) and helium ions (alpha-particles, 12%) but also HZE particles, including iron ( 56 Fe) 22 . High-LET radiation increases the multiplicity of damage types on a variety of target molecules in the cell, and poses significant challenges to cellular repair processes when this complex damage occurs on the DNA 23 .
In contrast to radiation doses experienced on the International Space Station (ISS) (range: 0.4 to 1.1 mGy/day) 23 , future long duration missions outside the protection of the Earth’s magnetosphere, or unshielded exposures to SPE, may achieve total doses capable of causing cancellous bone loss (i.e. 0.5–2 Gy) 22 , 24 . It is estimated that the maximum dose of exposure to space radiation over a protracted 3-year mission outside the magnetosphere would be ~2 Gy 22 , 24 , which equals the typical single fraction dose delivered during standard clinical radiotherapy 13 , 21 .
Cancellous bone loss caused by ionizing radiation occurs quite rapidly in rodents (within two weeks). Initially, radiation increases the expression of pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines in both marrow cells and mineralized tissue and increases the number and activity of bone-resorbing osteoclasts 5 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 . Total body irradiation (TBI) increases the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by marrow cells 1 and stimulates gene expression levels of pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines such as Rankl , Mcp1 , Tnf-α and Il-6 in addition to Nfe2l2 29 . Nfe2l2 encodes a master transcription factor that regulates the expression of more than 600 genes to help defend the cell from damaging ROS and resulting oxidative stress 30 . We showed previously that increases in gene expression for Nfe2l2 and osteoclastogenic cytokines one day after TBI precede the manifestation of bone loss (11 days post-TBI) 29 .
The changes in remodeling activity caused by exposure to radiation can lead to impaired structural integrity and fragility both in animal models and radiotherapy patients 3 , 13 , 21 . Radiation-induced bone loss resembles accelerated, age-related structural changes, particularly in rapid-turnover cancellous tissue. Over the course of three days to one month, relatively low doses of radiation ( < 2 Gy) can cause rapid and progressive strut thinning and removal of cancellous tissue as shown by our group and others 3 , 5 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 31 .
We hypothesized that diets or drugs capable of preventing the early increase in pro-osteoclastogenic and oxidative stress-related factors mitigate cancellous bone loss caused by both low LET and high LET radiation. To test this, we evaluated the following candidate interventions: (#1) an antioxidant diet cocktail (AOX), including 5 antioxidants (ascorbic acid, N-acetyl cysteine, L-selenomethionine, dihydrolipoic acid and vitamin E) reported to protect target tissues from ionizing radiation 32 , 33 , 34 , (#2) dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), which possesses antioxidant properties 4 , 35 , (#3) Ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug, to test the ability to prevent inflammation-related bone loss 36 , 37 and (#4) Dried Plum (DP, 25% by weight), shown to mitigate age-related bone loss as an anti-resorptive in other disease models 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 .
The candidate interventions first were evaluated using early gene expression markers (pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines, inflammatory and antioxidant responses) 29 one day after TBI. Interventions were then tested for their ability to prevent radiation-induced cancellous bone loss. Thus, analysis of early changes in gene expression levels for osteoclastogenic cytokines after exposure to ionizing radiation served both to identify potentially effective interventions, and to further establish the relevance of early changes in marrow cytokine expression for cancellous bone loss. Here we report that one of our selected interventions (DP diet) completely prevented cancellous bone loss caused by ionizing radiation.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-scirep.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7ed5/4750446/0d8b5762090f/srep21343-f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7ed5/4750446/0f1d8af4dd2f/srep21343-f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7ed5/4750446/445b54547933/srep21343-f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7ed5/4750446/e27c7be41b86/srep21343-f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7ed5/4750446/4ccaacd49f7c/srep21343-f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7ed5/4750446/7608266126e8/srep21343-f6.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7ed5/4750446/df773ad435de/srep21343-f7.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Dietary countermeasure mitigates simulated spaceflight-induced osteopenia in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162976/,"Spaceflight is a unique environment that includes at least two factors which can negatively impact skeletal health: microgravity and ionizing radiation. We have previously shown that a diet supplemented with dried plum powder (DP) prevented radiation-induced bone loss in mice. In this study, we investigated the capacity of the DP diet to prevent bone loss in mice following exposure to simulated spaceflight, combining microgravity (by hindlimb unloading) and radiation exposure. The DP diet was effective at preventing most decrements in bone micro-architectural and mechanical properties due to hindlimb unloading alone and simulated spaceflight. Furthermore, we show that the DP diet can protect osteoprogenitors from impairments resulting from simulated microgravity. Based on our findings, a dietary supplementation with DP could be an effective countermeasure against the skeletal deficits observed in astronauts during spaceflight.

Simulated microgravity alters gene regulation linked to immunity and cardiovascular disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11353732/,"Microgravity exposure induces a cephalad fluid shift and an overall reduction in physical activity levels which can lead to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of countermeasures. Future spaceflight missions will expose crew to extended periods of microgravity among other stressors, the effects of which on cardiovascular health are not fully known. In this study, we determined cardiac responses to extended microgravity exposure using the rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model. We hypothesized that exposure to prolonged simulated microgravity and subsequent recovery would lead to increased oxidative damage and altered expression of genes involved in the oxidative response. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts of male (three and nine months of age) and female (3 months of age) Long–Evans rats that underwent HU for various durations up to 90 days and reambulated up to 90 days post-HU. Results indicate sex-dependent changes in oxidative damage marker 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and antioxidant gene expression in left ventricular tissue. Three-month-old females displayed elevated 8-OHdG levels after 14 days of HU while age-matched males did not. In nine-month-old males, there were no differences in 8-OHdG levels between HU and normally loaded control males at any of the timepoints tested following HU. RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space.

Autophagy and its consequences for platelet biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11953390/,"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a multifaceted and gradually advancing condition characterized by a complex pathogenesis. The current therapeutic options for CKD remain limited in efficacy. Consequently, the identification and exploration of novel drug targets for CKD are of paramount importance. We identified cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) with potential as drug targets from the eQTLGen Consortium database to serve as the exposure. For the outcome, we utilized a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic kidney disease (CKD) from the FinnGen database, which comprised a case group of 11,265 individuals and a control group of 436,208 individuals. MR analysis was employed to investigate druggable genes closely associated with CKD. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the functional roles of these significant genes. Finally, a colocalization analysis was conducted to determine the likelihood that a cis-eQTL for a druggable gene and CKD share a causal variant. The expression of 12 genes was found to be significantly associated with CKD risk, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that these genes are primarily involved in the regulation of MAP kinase activity, regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity, Gap junction, Platelet activation and Oxytocin signaling pathway. The colocalization analysis results suggested that CKD and the TUBB gene may share a causal variant, with a posterior probability (PP.H4) exceeding 80% (TUBB: 97.27%). Compelling statistical evidence indicates that TUBB represents the most promising pharmacological target for the treatment of CKD. This study not only identifies potential therapeutic targets but also offers valuable insights for future drug development in the context of CKD.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-scirep.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0971/11953390/e24eebe2235e/41598_2025_94761_Fig1_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0971/11953390/f7c7e8e825c2/41598_2025_94761_Fig2_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0971/11953390/10cc80485b14/41598_2025_94761_Fig3_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0971/11953390/dfd9afe7710b/41598_2025_94761_Fig4_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0971/11953390/70f5d571d41e/41598_2025_94761_Fig5_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0971/11953390/e0168082439d/41598_2025_94761_Fig6_HTML.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
A new role of NAP1L1 in megakaryocytes and human platelets,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9737020/,"Platelets (PLTs) are anucleate and considered incapable of nuclear functions. Contrastingly, nuclear proteins were detected in human PLTs. For most of these proteins, it is unclear if nuclear or alternatively assigned functions are performed, a question we wanted to address for n uclear a ssembly p rotein 1 l ike 1 (NAP1L1). Using a wide array of molecular methods, including RNAseq, co-IP, overexpression and functional assays, we explored expression pattern and functionality of NAP1L1 in PLTs, and CD34 + -derived megakaryocytes (MKs). NAP1L1 is expressed in PLTs and MKs. Co-IP experiments revealed that dihydrolipolylysine-residue acetyltransferase (DLAT encoded protein PDC-E2, ODP2) dynamically interacts with NAP1L1. PDC-E2 is part of the mitochondrial pyruvate-dehydrogenase (PDH) multi-enzyme complex, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular respiration, and promoting ATP-synthesis via the respiratory chain. Since altered mitochondrial function is a hallmark of infectious syndromes, we analyzed PDH activity in PLTs from septic patients demonstrating increased activity, paralleling NAP1L1 expression levels. MKs PDH activity decreased following an LPS-challenge. Furthermore, overexpression of NAP1L1 significantly altered the ability of MKs to form proplatelet extensions, diminishing thrombopoiesis. These results indicate that NAP1L1 performs in other than nucleosome-assembly functions in PTLs and MKs, binding a key mitochondrial protein as a potential chaperone, and gatekeeper, influencing PDH activity and thrombopoiesis.

Morphology of Penicillium rubens Biofilms Formed in Space,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10144393/,"Fungi biofilms have been found growing on spacecraft surfaces such as windows, piping, cables, etc. The contamination of these surfaces with fungi, although undesirable, is highly difficult to avoid. While several biofilm forming species, including Penicillium rubens , have been identified in spacecraft, the effect of microgravity on fungal biofilm formation is unknown. This study sent seven material surfaces (Stainless Steel 316, Aluminum Alloy, Titanium Alloy, Carbon Fiber, Quartz, Silicone, and Nanograss) inoculated with spores of P. rubens to the International Space Station and allowed biofilms to form for 10, 15, and 20 days to understand the effects of microgravity on biofilm morphology and growth. In general, microgravity did not induce changes in the shape of biofilms, nor did it affect growth in terms of biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage. However, microgravity increased or decreased biofilm formation in some cases, and this was incubation-time- and material-dependent. Nanograss was the material with significantly less biofilm formation, both in microgravity and on Earth, and it could potentially be interfering with hyphal adhesion and/or spore germination. Additionally, a decrease in biofilm formation at 20 days, potentially due to nutrient depletion, was seen in some space and Earth samples and was material-dependent.

Explainable machine learning identifies multi-omics signatures of muscle response to spaceflight in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10719374/,"The adverse effects of microgravity exposure on mammalian physiology during spaceflight necessitate a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms to develop effective countermeasures. One such concern is muscle atrophy, which is partly attributed to the dysregulation of calcium levels due to abnormalities in SERCA pump functioning. To identify potential biomarkers for this condition, multi-omics data and physiological data available on the NASA Open Science Data Repository (osdr.nasa.gov) were used, and machine learning methods were employed. Specifically, we used multi-omics (transcriptomic, proteomic, and DNA methylation) data and calcium reuptake data collected from C57BL/6 J mouse soleus and tibialis anterior tissues during several 30+ day-long missions on the international space station. The QLattice symbolic regression algorithm was introduced to generate highly explainable models that predict either experimental conditions or calcium reuptake levels based on multi-omics features. The list of candidate models established by QLattice was used to identify key features contributing to the predictive capability of these models, with Acyp1 and Rps7 proteins found to be the most predictive biomarkers related to the resilience of the tibialis anterior muscle in space. These findings could serve as targets for future interventions aiming to reduce the extent of muscle atrophy during space travel.

Microbial adaptation to spaceflight is correlated with bacteriophage-encoded functions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11096397/,"Evidence from the International Space Station suggests microbial populations are rapidly adapting to the spacecraft environment; however, the mechanism of this adaptation is not understood. Bacteriophages are prolific mediators of bacterial adaptation on Earth. Here we survey 245 genomes sequenced from bacterial strains isolated on the International Space Station for dormant (lysogenic) bacteriophages. Our analysis indicates phage-associated genes are significantly different between spaceflight strains and their terrestrial counterparts. In addition, we identify 283 complete prophages, those that could initiate bacterial lysis and infect additional hosts, of which 21% are novel. These prophage regions encode functions that correlate with increased persistence in extreme environments, such as spaceflight, to include antimicrobial resistance and virulence, DNA damage repair, and dormancy. Our results correlate microbial adaptation in spaceflight to bacteriophage-encoded functions that may impact human health in spaceflight.

Influence of the spaceflight environment on macrophage lineages,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166655/,"Spaceflight and terrestrial spaceflight analogs can alter immune phenotypes. Macrophages are important immune cells that bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems and participate in immunoregulatory processes of homeostasis. Furthermore, macrophages are critically involved in initiating immunity, defending against injury and infection, and are also involved in immune resolution and wound healing. Heterogeneous populations of macrophage-type cells reside in many tissues and cause a variety of tissue-specific effects through direct or indirect interactions with other physiological systems, including the nervous and endocrine systems. It is vital to understand how macrophages respond to the unique environment of space to safeguard crew members with appropriate countermeasures for future missions in low Earth orbit and beyond. This review highlights current literature on macrophage responses to spaceflight and spaceflight analogs.

MARSBOx: Fungal and bacterial endurance from a balloon-flown analog mission in the stratosphere,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7937622/,"Whether terrestrial life can withstand the martian environment is of paramount interest for planetary protection measures and space exploration. To understand microbial survival potential in Mars-like conditions, several fungal and bacterial samples were launched in September 2019 on a large NASA scientific balloon flight to the middle stratosphere (∼38 km altitude) where radiation levels resembled values at the equatorial Mars surface. Fungal spores of Aspergillus niger and bacterial cells of Salinisphaera shabanensis , Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis , and Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 were launched inside the MARSBOx (Microbes in Atmosphere for Radiation, Survival, and Biological Outcomes Experiment) payload filled with an artificial martian atmosphere and pressure throughout the mission profile. The dried microorganisms were either exposed to full UV-VIS radiation (UV dose = 1148 kJ m −2 ) or were shielded from radiation. After the 5-h stratospheric exposure, samples were assayed for survival and metabolic changes. Spores from the fungus A. niger and cells from the Gram-(–) bacterium S. shabanensis were the most resistant with a 2- and 4-log reduction, respectively. Exposed Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 was completely inactivated (both with and without UV exposure) and S. capitis subsp. capitis only survived the UV shielded experimental condition (3-log reduction). Our results underscore a wide variation in survival phenotypes of spacecraft associated microorganisms and support the hypothesis that pigmented fungi may be resistant to the martian surface if inadvertently delivered by spacecraft missions.

In situ linkage of fungal and bacterial proliferation to microbiologically influenced corrosion in B20 biodiesel storage tanks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7055474/,"Renewable fuels hold great promise for the future yet their susceptibility to biodegradation and subsequent corrosion represents a challenge that needs to be directly assessed. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that is widely used as a substitute or extender for petroleum diesel and is composed of a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters derived from plant or animal fats. Biodiesel can be blended up to 20% v/v with ultra-low sulfur diesel (i.e., B20) and used interchangeably with diesel engines and infrastructure. The addition of biodiesel, however, has been linked to increased susceptibility to biodegradation. Microorganisms proliferating via degradation of biodiesel blends have been linked to microbiologically influenced corrosion in the laboratory, but not measured directly in storage tanks (i.e., in situ ). To measure in situ microbial proliferation, fuel degradation and microbially influenced corrosion, we conducted a yearlong study of B20 storage tanks in operation at two locations, identified the microorganisms associated with fuel fouling, and measured in situ corrosion. The bacterial populations were more diverse than the fungal populations, and largely unique to each location. The bacterial populations included members of the Acetobacteraceae, Clostridiaceae , and Proteobacteria. The abundant Eukaryotes at both locations consisted of the same taxa, including a filamentous fungus within the family Trichocomaceae , not yet widely recognized as a contaminant of petroleum fuels, and the Saccharomycetaceae family of yeasts. Increases in the absolute and relative abundances of the Trichocomaceae were correlated with significant, visible fouling and pitting corrosion. This study identified the relationship between fouling of B20 with increased rates of corrosion and the microorganisms responsible, largely at the bottom of the sampled storage tanks.

Nature of pre-earthquake phenomena and their effects on living organisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4494396/,"Earthquakes occur when tectonic stresses build up deep in the Earth before catastrophic rupture. During the build-up of stress, processes that occur in the crustal rocks lead to the activation of highly mobile electronic charge carriers. These charge carriers are able to flow out of the stressed rock volume into surrounding rocks. Such outflow constitutes an electric current, which generates electromagnetic (EM) signals. If the outflow occurs in bursts, it will lead to short EM pulses. If the outflow is continuous, the currents may fluctuate, generating EM emissions over a wide frequency range. Only ultralow and extremely low frequency (ULF/ELF) waves travel through rock and can reach the Earth surface. The outflowing charge carriers are (i) positively charged and (ii) highly oxidizing. When they arrive at the Earth surface from below, they build up microscopic electric fields, strong enough to field-ionize air molecules. As a result, the air above the epicentral region of an impending major earthquake often becomes laden with positive airborne ions. Medical research has long shown that positive airborne ions cause changes in stress hormone levels in animals and humans. In addition to the ULF/ELF emissions, positive airborne ions can cause unusual reactions among animals. When the charge carriers flow into water, they oxidize water to hydrogen peroxide. This, plus oxidation of organic compounds, can cause behavioral changes among aquatic animals.

The rapid diagnosis and effective inhibition of coronavirus using spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8323809/,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the coronavirus disease that began in 2019 (COVID-19), has been responsible for 1.4 million deaths worldwide as of 13 November 2020. Because at the time of writing no vaccine is yet available, a rapid diagnostic assay is very urgently needed. Herein, we present the development of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles for the rapid diagnosis of specific COVID-19 viral antigen or virus via a simple colorimetric change observation within a 5 minute time period. For rapid and highly sensitive identification, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was employed using 4-aminothiophenol as a reporter molecule, which is attached to the gold nanoparticle via an Au–S bond. In the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles, owing to the antigen–antibody interaction, the gold nanoparticles undergo aggregation, changing color from pink to blue, which allows for the determination of the presence of antigen or virus very rapidly by the naked eye, even at concentrations of 1 nanogram (ng) per mL for COVID-19 antigen and 1000 virus particles per mL for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped baculovirus. Importantly, the aggregated gold nanoparticles form “hot spots” to provide very strong SERS signal enhancement from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles via light–matter interactions. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation data indicate a 4-orders-of-magnitude Raman enhancement in “hot spot” positions when gold nanoparticles form aggregates. Using a portable Raman analyzer, our reported data demonstrate that our antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticle-based SERS probe has the capability to detect COVID-19 antigen even at a concentration of 4 picograms (pg) per mL and virus at a concentration of 18 virus particles per mL within a 5 minute time period. Using HEK293T cells, which express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells, we show that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to inhibit infection by the virus. Our reported data show that antibody attached gold nanoparticles bind to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thereby inhibiting the virus from binding to cell receptors, which stops virus infection and spread. It also has the capability to destroy the lipid membrane of the virus.

Blocking SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein receptor-binding domain binding with the ACE2 receptor of the host cell and inhibiting virus infections using human host defense peptide-conjugated graphene quantum dots.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8886715/,"The emergence of
double mutation delta (B.1.617.2) variants has
dropped vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although
COVID-19 is responsible for more than 5.4 M deaths till now, more
than 40% of infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers as the
immune system of the human body can control the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Herein, we report for the first time that human host defense neutrophil
α-defensin HNP1 and human cathelicidin LL-37 peptide-conjugated
graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have the capability to prevent the delta
variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking SARS-CoV-2 delta
variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) binding
with host cells’ angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Experimental
data shows that due to the binding between the delta variant spike
protein RBD and bioconjugate GQDs, in the presence of the delta variant
spike protein, the fluorescence signal from GQDs quenched abruptly.
Experimental quenching data shows a nonlinear Stern–Volmer
quenching profile, which indicates multiple binding sites. Using the
modified Hill equation, we have determined n = 2.6
and the effective binding affinity 9 nM, which is comparable with
the ACE2–spike protein binding affinity (8 nM). Using the alpha,
beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD, experimental data shows that the
binding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those
for the other variants. Further investigation using the HEK293T-human
ACE2 cell line indicates that peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability
for completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions
into host cells via blocking the ACE2–spike protein binding.
Experimental data shows that the inhibition efficiency for LL-37 peptide-
and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are much higher than that of only one
type of peptide-attached GQDs.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-acsomega.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7bf9/8908481/3477168b0c9e/ao2c00113_0006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7bf9/8908481/89651fa2c3db/ao2c00113_0002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7bf9/8908481/d1748114d3c6/ao2c00113_0003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7bf9/8908481/9e9904807690/ao2c00113_m001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7bf9/8908481/2d271ca0c6ca/ao2c00113_m002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7bf9/8908481/2d7b9f906b97/ao2c00113_m003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7bf9/8908481/cc445a5a8012/ao2c00113_0004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7bf9/8908481/4fbd9ab23552/ao2c00113_0005.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) strains by marine sulfated glycans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9487896/,"The Coronavirus disease pandemic has steered the global therapeutic research efforts toward the discovery of potential anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) molecules. The role of the viral spike glycoprotein (S-protein) has been clearly established in SARS-CoV-2 infection through its capacity to bind to the host cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. The antiviral strategies targeting these 2 virus receptors are currently under intense investigation. However, the rapid evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genome has resulted in numerous mutations in the S-protein posing a significant challenge for the design of S-protein-targeted inhibitors. As an example, the 2 key mutations in the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), L452R, and T478K in the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) confer tighter binding to the host epithelial cells. Marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) demonstrate excellent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 via competitive disruption of the S-protein RBD-HSPG interactions and thus have the potential to be developed into effective prophylactic and therapeutic molecules. In this study, 7 different MSGs were evaluated for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in a virus entry assay utilizing a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus coated with S-protein of the wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) or the Delta (B.1.617.2) strain. Although all tested MSGs showed strong inhibitory activity against both strains, no correlations between MSG structural features and virus inhibition could be drawn. Nevertheless, the current study provides evidence for the maintenance of inhibitory activity of MSGs against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains.

Inhibition of Cytomegalovirus by Pentacta pygmaea Fucosylated Chondroitin Sulfate Depends on Its Molecular Weight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10142442/,"Many viruses attach to host cells by first interacting with cell surface proteoglycans containing heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains and then by engaging with specific receptor, resulting in virus entry. In this project, HS–virus interactions were targeted by a new fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from the sea cucumber Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) in order to block human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) entry into cells. Human foreskin fibroblasts were infected with HCMV in the presence of PpFucCS and its low molecular weight (LMW) fractions and the virus yield at five days post-infection was assessed. The virus attachment and entry into the cells were visualized by labeling the purified virus particles with a self-quenching fluorophore octadecyl rhodamine B (R18). The native PpFucCS exhibited potent inhibitory activity against HCMV specifically blocking virus entry into the cell and the inhibitory activities of the LMW PpFucCS derivatives were proportional to their chain lengths. PpFucCS and the derived oligosaccharides did not exhibit any significant cytotoxicity; moreover, they protected the infected cells from virus-induced lytic cell death. In conclusion, PpFucCS inhibits the entry of HCMV into cells and the high MW of this carbohydrate is a key structural element to achieve the maximal anti-viral effect. This new marine sulfated glycan can be developed into a potential prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral agent against HCMV infection.

Effect of simulated cosmic radiation on cytomegalovirus reactivation and lytic replication,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11477029/,"Human exploration of the solar system will expose crew members to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), with a potential for adverse health effects. GCR particles (protons and ions) move at nearly the speed of light and easily penetrate space station walls, as well as the human body. Previously, we have shown reactivation of latent herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus, Epstein–Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), during stays at the International Space Station. Given the prevalence of latent CMV and the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating latent CMV. Latently infected Kasumi cells with CMV were irradiated with 137 Cs gamma rays, 150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, 600 MeV/n iron ions, proton ions, and simulated GCR. The CMV copy number increased significantly in the cells exposed to radiation as compared with the non-irradiated controls. Viral genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. However, transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of transcription of the UL49 ORF, implicating it in the switch from latent to lytic replication. These findings support our hypothesis that GCR may be a strong contributor to the reactivation of CMV infection seen in ISS crew members.

A Tissue Retrieval and Postharvest Processing Regimen for Rodent Reproductive Tissues Compatible with Long-Term Storage on the International Space Station and Postflight Biospecimen Sharing Program,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4309301/,"Collection and processing of tissues to preserve space flight effects from animals after return to Earth is challenging. Specimens must be harvested with minimal time after landing to minimize postflight readaptation alterations in protein expression/translation, posttranslational modifications, and expression, as well as changes in gene expression and tissue histological degradation after euthanasia. We report the development of a widely applicable strategy for determining the window of optimal species-specific and tissue-specific posteuthanasia harvest that can be utilized to integrate into multi-investigator Biospecimen Sharing Programs. We also determined methods for ISS-compatible long-term tissue storage (10 months at −80°C) that yield recovery of high quality mRNA and protein for western analysis after sample return. Our focus was reproductive tissues. The time following euthanasia where tissues could be collected and histological integrity was maintained varied with tissue and species ranging between 1 and 3 hours. RNA quality was preserved in key reproductive tissues fixed in RNA later up to 40 min after euthanasia. Postfixation processing was also standardized for safe shipment back to our laboratory. Our strategy can be adapted for other tissues under NASA's Biospecimen Sharing Program or similar multi-investigator tissue sharing opportunities.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-bmri.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6730/4309301/b373e2f55f79/BMRI2015-475935.001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6730/4309301/57f3ea6b51a1/BMRI2015-475935.002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6730/4309301/8ce644b34ad7/BMRI2015-475935.003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6730/4309301/4e064e709e40/BMRI2015-475935.004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6730/4309301/d7703dccb59c/BMRI2015-475935.005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6730/4309301/479885ab518f/BMRI2015-475935.006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6730/4309301/03dc6b5b3874/BMRI2015-475935.007.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Effects of sex and gender on adaptations to space: reproductive health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166981/,"Organismal adaptations to spaceflight have been characterized at the molecular level in model organisms, including Drosophila and C. elegans . Here, we extend molecular work to energy metabolism and sex hormone signaling in mice and humans. We found spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen signaling in rodents and humans. Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways. Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful interplanetary species.

Effects of spaceflight on the muscles of the murine shoulder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6343501/,"The musculoskeletal system is sensitive to its loading environment; this is of particular concern under conditions such as disuse, paralysis, and extended-duration space flight. Although structural and mechanical changes to tendon and bone following paralysis and disuse are well understood, there is a pressing need to understand how this unloading affects the bone-tendon interface (enthesis); the location most prone to tears and injury. We therefore elucidated these effects of unloading in the entheses of adult mice shoulders that were paralyzed for 21 days by treatment with botulinum toxin A. Unloading significantly increased the extent of mechanical failure and was associated with structural changes across hierarchical scales. At the millimeter scale, unloading caused bone loss. At the micrometer scale, unloading decreased bioapatite crystal size and crystallographic alignment in the enthesis. At the nanometer scale, unloading induced compositional changes that stiffened the bioapatite/collagen composite tissue. Mathematical modeling and mechanical testing indicated that these factors combined to increase local elevations of stress while decreasing the ability of the tissue to absorb energy prior to failure, thereby increasing injury risk. These first observations of the multiscale effects of unloading on the adult enthesis provide new insight into the hierarchical features of structure and composition that endow the enthesis with increased resistance to failure.

Multiscale effects of spaceflight on murine tendon and bone,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7138367/,"Despite a wealth of data on the effects of spaceflight on tendons and bones, little is known about its effects on the interfacial tissue between these two structures, the enthesis. Mice were sent to space on three separate missions: STS-131, STS-135, and Bion-M1 to determine how spaceflight affects the composition, structure, mechanics, and gene expression of the humerus-supraspinatus and calcaneus-Achilles entheses. At the nanoscale, spaceflight resulted in decreased carbonate levels in the bone, likely due to increased remodeling, as suggested by increased expression of genes related to osteoclastogenesis ( CatK , Tnfsf11) and mature osteoblasts ( Col1 , Osc) . Tendons showed a shift in collagen fibril size towards smaller diameters that may have resulted from increased expression of genes related to collagen degradation ( Mmp3, Mmp13) . These nanoscale changes did not result in micro- and milliscale changes to the structure and mechanics of the enthesis. There were no changes in bone volume, trabecular structure, failure load, or stiffness with spaceflight. This lack of tissue-level change may be anatomy based, as extremities may be less sensitive to spaceflight than central locations such as vertebrae, yet results highlight that the tendon enthesis may be robust against negative effects of spaceflight.

Failure to Generate Bone Marrow Adipocytes Does Not Protect Mice from Ovariectomy-Induced Osteopenia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3564669/,"A reciprocal association between bone marrow fat and bone mass has been reported in ovariectomized rodents, suggesting that bone marrow adipogenesis has a negative effect on bone growth and turnover balance. Mice with loss of function mutations in kit receptor ( kit W/W-v ) have no bone marrow adipocytes in tibia or lumbar vertebra. We therefore tested the hypothesis that marrow fat contributes to development of osteopenia by comparing the skeletal response to ovariectomy (ovx) in growing wild type (WT) and bone marrow adipocyte-deficient kit W/W-v mice. Mice were ovx at 4 weeks of age and sacrificed 4 or 10 weeks post-surgery. Body composition was measured at necropsy by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Cortical (tibia) and cancellous (tibia and lumbar vertebra) bone architecture were evaluated by microcomputed tomography. Bone marrow adipocyte size and density, osteoblast- and osteoclast-lined bone perimeters, and bone formation were determined by histomorphometry. Ovx resulted in an increase in total body fat mass at 10 weeks post-ovx in both genotypes, but the response was attenuated in the in kit W/W-v mice. Adipocytes were present in bone marrow of tibia and lumbar vertebra in WT mice and bone marrow adiposity increased following ovx. In contrast, marrow adipocytes were not detected in either intact or ovx kit W/W-v mice. However, ovx in WT and kit W/W-v mice resulted in statistically indistinguishable changes in cortical and cancellous bone mass, cortical and cancellous bone formation rate, and cancellous osteoblast and osteoclast-lined bone perimeters. In conclusion, our findings do not support a causal role for increased bone marrow fat as a mediator of ovx-induced osteopenia in mice.

Acute exposure to high dose gamma-radiation results in transient activation of bone lining cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4042434/,"The present studies investigated the cellular mechanisms for the detrimental effects of high dose whole body γ-irradiation on bone. In addition, radioadaptation and bone marrow transplantation were assessed as interventions to mitigate the skeletal complications of irradiation. Increased trabecular thickness and separation and reduced fractional cancellous bone volume, connectivity density, and trabecular number were detected in proximal tibia and lumbar vertebra 14 days following γ-irradiation with 6 Gy. To establish the cellular mechanism for the architectural changes, vertebrae were analyzed by histomorphometry 1, 3, and 14 days following irradiation. Marrow cell density decreased within 1 day (67% reduction, p<0.0001), reached a minimum value after 3 days (86% reduction, p<0.0001), and partially rebounded by 14 days (30% reduction, p=0.0025) following irradiation. In contrast, osteoblast-lined bone perimeter was increased by 290% (1 day, p=0.04), 1230% (3 days, p<0.0001), and 530% (14 days, p=0.003), respectively. There was a strong association between radiation-induced marrow cell death and activation of bone lining cells to express the osteoblast phenotype (Pearson correlation −0.85, p<0.0001). An increase (p=0.004) in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter was also detected with irradiation. A priming dose of γ-radiation (0.5 mGy), previously shown to reduce mortality, had minimal effect on the cellular responses to radiation and did not prevent detrimental changes in bone architecture. Bone marrow transplantation normalized marrow cell density, bone turnover, and most indices of bone architecture following irradiation. In summary, radiation-induced death of marrow cells is associated with 1) a transient increase in bone formation due, at least in part, to activation of bone lining cells, and 2) an increase in bone resorption due to increased osteoclast perimeter. Bone marrow transplantation is effective in mitigating the detrimental effects of acute exposure to high dose whole body γ-radiation on bone turnover.

Morbid obesity attenuates the skeletal abnormalities associated with leptin deficiency in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4161659/,"Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are morbidly obese and exhibit low total bone mass and mild osteopetrosis. In order to disassociate the skeletal effects of leptin deficiency from those associated with morbid obesity, we evaluated bone mass, architecture, gene expression, and indices of bone turnover in wild type (WT) mice, ob/ob mice fed ad libitum ( ob/ob ) , and ob/ob mice pair fed to WT mice (pair-fed ob/ob ). Mice were maintained at 32°C (thermoneutral) from 6 to 18 weeks of age to minimize differences in resting energy expenditure. ob/ob mice were heavier, had more abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT), and were hyperglycemic compared to WT mice. Femur length, bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density, and midshaft femur cortical thickness were lower in ob/ob mice than in WT mice. Cancellous bone volume fraction was higher but indices of bone formation and resorption were lower in ob/ob compared to WT mice; reduced bone resorption in ob/ob mice resulted in pathological retention of calcified cartilage. Pair-fed ob/ob mice were lighter, had lower WAT, uterine weight, and serum glucose than ob/ob mice. Similarly, femoral length, BMC, and cortical thickness were lower in pair-fed ob/ob mice compared to ob/ob mice, as were indices of cancellous bone formation and resorption. In contrast, bone marrow adiposity, calcified cartilage and cancellous bone volume fraction were higher at one or more cancellous sites in pair-fed ob/ob mice compared to ob/ob mice. These findings demonstrate that the skeletal abnormalities caused by leptin deficiency are markedly attenuated in morbidly obese ob/ob mice.

Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy reduces body weight without accelerating age-related bone loss,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4917201/,"Excessive weight gain in adults is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes. Unfortunately, dieting, exercise, and pharmacological interventions have had limited long-term success in weight control and can result in detrimental side effects, including accelerating age-related cancellous bone loss. We investigated the efficacy of using hypothalamic leptin gene therapy as an alternative method for reducing weight in skeletally-mature (9-month-old) female rats and determined the impact of leptin-induced weight loss on bone mass, density, and microarchitecture, and serum biomarkers of bone turnover (CTx and osteocalcin). Rats were implanted with cannulae in the 3rd ventricle of the hypothalamus and injected with either recombinant adeno-associated virus encoding the gene for rat leptin (rAAV-Leptin, n=7) or a control vector encoding green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP, n=10) and sacrificed 18 weeks later. A baseline control group (n=7) was sacrificed at vector administration. rAAV-Leptin-treated rats lost weight (−4±2%) while rAAV-GFP-treated rats gained weight (14±2%) during the study. At study termination, rAAV-Leptin-treated rats weighed 17% less than rAAV-GFP-treated rats and had lower abdominal white adipose tissue weight (−80%), serum leptin (−77%), and serum IGF1 (−34%). Cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis, and in lumbar vertebra tended to be lower (p<0.1) in rAAV-GFP-treated rats (13.5-months-old) compared to baseline control rats (9-months-old). Significant differences in cancellous bone or biomarkers of bone turnover were not detected between rAAV-Leptin and rAAV-GFP rats. In summary, rAAV-Leptin-treated rats maintained a lower body weight compared to baseline and rAAV-GFP-treated rats with minimal effects on bone mass, density, microarchitecture, or biochemical markers of bone turnover.

Hypothalamic Leptin Gene Therapy Reduces Bone Marrow Adiposity in ob/ob Mice Fed Regular and High-Fat Diets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4985531/,"Low bone mass is often associated with elevated bone marrow adiposity. Since osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from the same mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) progenitor, adipocyte formation may increase at the expense of osteoblast formation. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone known to regulate energy and bone metabolism. Leptin deficiency and high-fat diet-induced obesity are associated with increased marrow adipose tissue (MAT) and reduced bone formation. Short-duration studies suggest that leptin treatment reduces MAT and increases bone formation in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice fed a regular diet. Here, we determined the long-duration impact of increased hypothalamic leptin on marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts in ob/ob mice following recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy. Eight- to 10-week-old male ob/ob mice were randomized into four groups: (1) untreated, (2) rAAV-Lep, (3) rAAV-green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP), or (4) pair-fed to rAAV-Lep. For vector administration, mice were injected intracerebroventricularly with either rAAV-leptin gene therapy (rAAV-Lep) or rAAV-GFP (9 × 10 7 particles) and maintained for 30 weeks. In a second study, the impact of increased hypothalamic leptin levels on MAT was determined in mice fed high-fat diets; ob/ob mice were randomized into two groups and treated with either rAAV-Lep or rAAV-GFP. At 7 weeks post-vector administration, half the mice in each group were switched to a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. Wild-type (WT) controls included age-matched mice fed regular or high-fat diet. High-fat diet resulted in a threefold increase in MAT in WT mice, whereas MAT was increased by leptin deficiency up to 50-fold. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increased osteoblast perimeter and osteoclast perimeter with minor change in cancellous bone architecture. The gene therapy decreased MAT levels in ob/ob mice fed regular or high-fat diet to values similar to WT mice fed regular diet. These findings suggest that leptin plays an important role in regulating the differentiation of MSCs to adipocytes and osteoblasts, a process that may be dysregulated by high-fat diet. However, the results also illustrate that reducing MAT by increasing leptin levels does not necessarily result in increased bone mass.

Spaceflight-induced vertebral bone loss in ovariectomized rats is associated with increased bone marrow adiposity and no change in bone formation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515514/,"There is often a reciprocal relationship between bone marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts, suggesting that marrow adipose tissue (MAT) antagonizes osteoblast differentiation. MAT is increased in rodents during spaceflight but a causal relationship between MAT and bone loss remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a 14-day spaceflight on bone mass, bone resorption, bone formation, and MAT in lumbar vertebrae of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Twelve-week-old OVX Fischer 344 rats were randomly assigned to a ground control or flight group. Following flight, histological sections of the second lumbar vertebrae ( n =11/group) were stained using a technique that allowed simultaneous quantification of cells and preflight fluorochrome label. Compared with ground controls, rats flown in space had 32% lower cancellous bone area and 306% higher MAT. The increased adiposity was due to an increase in adipocyte number (224%) and size (26%). Mineral apposition rate and osteoblast turnover were unchanged during spaceflight. In contrast, resorption of a preflight fluorochrome and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter were increased (16% and 229%, respectively). The present findings indicate that cancellous bone loss in rat lumbar vertebrae during spaceflight is accompanied by increased bone resorption and MAT but no change in bone formation. These findings do not support the hypothesis that increased MAT during spaceflight reduces osteoblast activity or lifespan. However, in the context of ovarian hormone deficiency, bone formation during spaceflight was insufficient to balance increased resorption, indicating defective coupling. The results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that during spaceflight mesenchymal stem cells are diverted to adipocytes at the expense of forming osteoblasts.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-npjmicrogr.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ef85/5515514/7e521132b803/npjmgrav201616-f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ef85/5515514/d92c0227f957/npjmgrav201616-f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ef85/5515514/5674ec93fcb7/npjmgrav201616-f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ef85/5515514/b4eef6cce68b/npjmgrav201616-f4.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Role of oestrogen receptor signaling in skeletal response to leptin in female ob/ob mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8671758/,"The absence of leptin results in contrasting growth pattern of appendicular and axial bone growth in ob/ob mice. Endochondral bone formation is an important procedure of growth plate determining the bone growth, where this procedure is also regulated by estrogen and its receptor (ER) signaling pathway. The present study is undertaken to explore the roles of ERs in regulating the different growth patterns in ob/ob mice. In this study, C57BL/6 female mice were used as wild-type (WT) mice; ob/ob mice and WT mice were age-matched fed, and bone length is analyzed by X-ray plain film at the 12 weeks old. We confirm that ob/ob mice have shorter femoral length and longer spine length than WT mice ( p < 0.05). The contrasting expression patterns of chondrocyte proliferation proteins and hypertrophic marker proteins are also observed from the femur and spinal growth plate of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice ( p < 0.01). Spearman’s analysis showed that body length (axial and appendicular length) is positively related to the expression level of ERα in growth plate. Three-week-old female ob/ob mice are randomized divided into three groups: 1) ob/ob + ctrl, 2) ob/ob + ERα antagonist (MPP), and 3) ob/ob + ERβ antagonist (PHTPP). Age-matched C57BL/6 mice were also divided into three groups, same as the groups of ob/ob mice. MPP and PHTPP were administered by intraperitoneal injection for 6 weeks. However, the results of X-ray and H&E staining demonstrate that leptin deficiency seems to disturb the regulating effects of ER antagonists on longitudinal bone growth. These findings suggested that region-specific expression of ERα might be associated with contrasting phenotypes of axial and appendicular bone growth in ob/ob mice. However, ER signaling on longitudinal bone growth was blunted by leptin deficiency in ob/ob mice, and the underlying association between ERs and leptin needs to be explored in future work.

Effects of hypothalamic leptin gene therapy on osteopetrosis in leptin-deficient mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5771473/,"Impaired resorption of cartilage matrix deposited during endochondral ossification is a defining feature of juvenile osteopetrosis. Growing, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice exhibit a mild form of osteopetrosis. However, the extent to which the disease is (1) self-limiting and (2) reversible by leptin treatment is unknown. We addressed the first question by performing histomorphometric analysis of femurs in rapidly growing (2-month-old), slowly growing (4-month-old), and skeletally mature (6-month-old) wild type (WT) and ob/ob male mice. Absent by 6 months of age in WT mice, cartilage matrix persisted to varying extents in distal femur epiphysis, metaphysis and diaphysis in ob/ob mice, suggesting that the osteopetrotic phenotype is not entirely self-limiting. To address the second question, we employed hypothalamic recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy to restore leptin signaling in ob/ob mice. Two-month-old mice were randomized to one of three groups: (1) untreated control, (2) rAAV-Leptin, or (3) control vector rAAV-green fluorescent protein and vectors injected intracerebroventricularly. Seven months later, rAAV-Leptin-treated mice exhibited no cartilage in the metaphysis and greatly reduced cartilage in the epiphysis and diaphysis. At the cellular level, the reduction in cartilage was associated with increased bone turnover. These findings (1) support the concept that leptin is important for normal replacement of cartilage by bone, and (2) demonstrate that osteopetrosis in ob/ob mice is bone compartment specific and reversible by leptin at skeletal sites capable of undergoing robust bone turnover.

Leptin stimulates bone formation in ob/ob mice at doses having minimal impact on energy metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5288125/,"Leptin, the protein product of the ob gene, is essential for normal bone growth, maturation, and turnover. Peripheral actions of leptin occur at lower serum levels of the hormone than central actions because entry of leptin into the central nervous system (CNS) is limited due to its saturable transport across the blood brain barrier (BBB). We performed a study in mice to model the impact of leptin production associated with different levels of adiposity on bone formation and compared the response with well-established centrally-mediated actions of the hormone on energy metabolism. Leptin was infused (0, 4, 12, 40, 140, or 400 ng/h) for 12 days into 6-week-old female ob/ob mice (n=8/group) using sc implanted osmotic pumps. Treatment resulted in a dose-associated increase in serum leptin. Bone formation parameters were increased at EC 50 infusion rates of 7–17 ng/h whereas higher levels (EC 50 , 40–80 ng/h) were required to similarly impact indices of energy metabolism. We then analyzed gene expression in tibia and hypothalamus at dose rates of 0, 12 and 140 ng/h; the latter dose resulted in serum leptin levels similar to WT mice. Infusion with 12 ng/h leptin increased expression of genes associated with Jak/Stat signaling and bone formation in tibia with minimal effect on Jak/Stat signaling and neurotransmitters in hypothalamus. The results suggest that leptin acts peripherally to couple bone acquisition to energy availability and that limited transport across the BBB insures that the growth promoting actions of peripheral leptin are not curtailed by the hormone’s CNS-mediated anorexigenic actions.

Bone Marrow Adipose Tissue Deficiency Increases Disuse-Induced Bone Loss in Male Mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5389344/,"Bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) is negatively associated with bone mass. Since osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from the same precursor cells, adipocyte differentiation may occur at the expense of osteoblast differentiation. We used MAT-deficient Kit W/W−v (MAT-) mice to determine if absence of MAT reduced bone loss in hindlimb-unloaded (HU) mice. Male MAT- and wild-type (WT) mice were randomly assigned to a baseline, control or HU group (n = 10 mice/group) within each genotype and HU groups unloaded for 2 weeks. Femurs were evaluated using micro-computed tomography, histomorphometry and targeted gene profiling. MAT- mice had a greater reduction in bone volume fraction after HU than did WT mice. HU MAT- mice had elevated cancellous bone formation and resorption compared to other treatment groups as well as a unique profile of differentially expressed genes. Adoptive transfer of WT bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells reconstituted c-kit but not MAT in Kit W/W−v mice. The MAT- WT → Kit W/W−v mice lost cancellous bone following 2 weeks of HU. In summary, results from this study suggest that MAT deficiency was not protective, and was associated with exaggerated disuse-induced cancellous bone loss.
In long-duration spaceflight, the human skeleton adapts to microgravity by reducing the amount of bone in sites that are weight-bearing 1 . While new countermeasures have been implemented in a mission-specific manner, mitigating the metabolic changes of the skeleton in microgravity remains a challenge to the success of long-duration exploration class missions 2 , 3 .
An increase in bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) is commonly observed with a decline in bone mass. This association has been observed in humans in iliac crest biopsies and with non-invasive use of magnetic resonance imaging, and in animal models for aging, postmenopausal osteoporosis 4 and disuse 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 . Increased MAT was reported in humans following long-duration bedrest and in rodents during spaceflight 13 , 17 , 18 , 19 . Both osteoblasts and adipocytes differentiate from mesenchymal stem cells in the presence of specific transcription factors 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 . Since osteoblasts and adipocytes originate from the same progenitor pool within the bone marrow, it is possible that one cell type could be produced at the expense of the other 20 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 . However, a causal relationship has yet to be demonstrated. Thus, while conditions of disuse create a change in balance of cellular function within the bone marrow, it is not clear whether the concurrently observed infiltration of bone marrow fat actively contributes to bone loss.
We have previously identified Kit W/W−v mice as deficient in bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT-) in weight-bearing bones 30 , 31 . These mice have a loss of function mutation in c-kit, a receptor tyrosine kinase, located on selective hematopoietic lineage cells 32 , 33 . Since an inverse relationship between MAT accumulation and bone mass has been observed, we hypothesized that if MAT plays a causative role, MAT- mice would be resistant to disuse-induced bone loss. To test this hypothesis, we utilized hindlimb unloading (HU) as a ground-based model for spaceflight 34 . The HU model produces skeletal changes in hindlimbs of rodents similar to those observed in astronauts following spaceflight 35 . We therefore compared the skeletal response of adult male WT mice and MAT- mice to HU.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-scirep.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1489/5389344/0a867f558e58/srep46325-f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1489/5389344/52534674e101/srep46325-f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1489/5389344/f6261accac2a/srep46325-f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1489/5389344/9cf6f406be2c/srep46325-f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1489/5389344/f5016ebae0d1/srep46325-f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1489/5389344/1bc20fbd75a7/srep46325-f6.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1489/5389344/0b5eb4b28b99/srep46325-f7.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Metabolic Coupling Between Bone Marrow Adipose Tissue and Hematopoiesis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9784906/,"The mannose receptor C-type 1 (Mrc1) is a C-type lectin receptor expressed on the immune cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells (ECs) of several tissues, including the bone marrow (BM). Parallel to systemic metabolic alterations and hematopoietic cell proliferation, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding increases the expression of Mrc1 in sinusoidal ECs, thus calling for the investigation of its role in bone marrow cell reprogramming and the metabolic profile during obesity. Mrc1 −/− mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were fed an HFD (45% Kcal/diet) for 20 weeks. Weight gain was monitored during the diet regimen and glucose and insulin tolerance were assessed. Extensive flow cytometry profiling, histological, and proteomic analyses were performed. After HFD feeding, Mrc1 −/− mice presented impaired medullary hematopoiesis with reduced myeloid progenitors and mature cells in parallel with an increase in BM adipocytes compared to controls. Accordingly, circulating levels of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory monocytes decreased in Mrc1 −/− mice together with reduced infiltration of macrophages in the visceral adipose tissue and the liver compared to controls. Liver histological profiling coupled with untargeted proteomic analysis revealed that Mrc1 −/− mice presented decreased liver steatosis and the downregulation of proteins belonging to pathways involved in liver dysfunction. This profile was reflected by improved glucose and insulin response and reduced weight gain during HFD feeding in Mrc1 −/− mice compared to controls. Our data show that during HFD feeding, mannose receptor deficiency impacts BM and circulating immune cell subsets, which is associated with reduced systemic inflammation and resistance to obesity development.

Maintenance of near normal bone mass and architecture in lethally irradiated female mice following adoptive transfer with as few as 750 purified hematopoietic stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6548323/,"Total-body irradiation (TBI) followed by transfer of bone marrow cells from donors is routinely performed in immunology research and can be used to manipulate differentiation and/or function of bone cells. However, exposure to high-dose radiation can result in irreversible osteopenia, and transfer of heterogeneous cell populations can complicate interpretation of results. The goal of this research was to establish an approach for reconstituting bone marrow using small numbers of purified donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) without negatively affecting bone metabolism. Gamma-irradiated (9 Gy) WBB6F1 mice were engrafted with bone marrow cells (5 × 10 6 cells) or purified HSCs (3,000 cells) obtained from GFP transgenic mice. In vivo analysis and in vitro differentiation assays performed two months later established that both methods were effective in reconstituting the hematopoietic compartment with donor-derived cells. We confirmed these findings by engrafting C57Bl/6 (B6) mice with bone marrow cells or purified HSCs from CD45.1 B6 congenic mice. We next performed adoptive transfer of purified HSCs (750 cells) into WBB6F1 and radiosensitive Kit W/W-v mice and evaluated the skeleton two months later. Minimal differences were observed between controls and WBB6F1-engrafted mice that received fractionated doses of 2 × 5 Gy. Kit w/wv mice lost weight and became osteopenic after 2 × 5 Gy irradiations but these abnormalities were negligible after 5 Gy irradiation. Importantly, adoptive transfer of wild-type cells into Kit w/wv mice restored normal Kit expression in bone marrow. Together, these findings provide strong evidence for efficient engraftment with purified HSCs after lethal TBI with minimal collateral damage to bone. This approach will be useful for investigating mechanisms by which hematopoietic lineage cells regulate bone metabolism.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-nihpa.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c5e6/6548323/28c5029e2c1b/nihms-1029685-f0001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c5e6/6548323/4ef6d42cc85c/nihms-1029685-f0002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c5e6/6548323/95e2621abcc2/nihms-1029685-f0003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c5e6/6548323/f07066f22c46/nihms-1029685-f0004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c5e6/6548323/6398243db717/nihms-1029685-f0005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c5e6/6548323/7fce998dda47/nihms-1029685-f0006.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Effect of leptin deficiency on the skeletal response to hindlimb unloading in adult male mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6597714/,"Based on body weight, morbidly obese leptin-deficient ob/ob mice have less bone than expected, suggesting that leptin plays a role in the skeletal response to weight bearing. To evaluate this possibility, we compared the skeletal response of wild type (WT) and ob/ob mice to hindlimb unloading (HU). Mice were individually housed at 32 °C (thermoneutral) from 4 weeks of age (rapidly growing) to 16 weeks of age (approaching skeletal maturity). Mice were then randomized into one of 4 groups (n = 10/group): (1) WT control, (2) WT HU, (3) ob/ob control, and (4) ob/ob HU and the results analyzed by 2-way ANOVA. ob/ob mice pair-fed to WT mice had normal cancellous bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in distal femur, lower femur length and total bone area, mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD), and higher cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebra (LV). HU resulted in lower BMC and BMD in total femur, and lower BV/TV in distal femur and LV in both genotypes. Cancellous bone loss in femur in both genotypes was associated with increases in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter. In summary, leptin deficiency did not attenuate HU-induced osteopenia in male mice, suggesting that leptin is not required for bone loss induced by unweighting.

Thermoneutral housing attenuates premature cancellous bone loss in male C57BL/6J mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6865368/,"Mice are a commonly used model to investigate aging-related bone loss but, in contrast to humans, mice exhibit cancellous bone loss prior to skeletal maturity. The mechanisms mediating premature bone loss are not well established. However, our previous work in female mice suggests housing temperature is a critical factor. Premature cancellous bone loss was prevented in female C57BL/6J mice by housing the animals at thermoneutral temperature (where basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss). In the present study, we determined if the protective effects of thermoneutral housing extend to males. Male C57BL/6J mice were housed at standard room temperature (22°C) or thermoneutral (32°C) conditions from 5 (rapidly growing) to 16 (slowly growing) weeks of age. Mice housed at room temperature exhibited reductions in cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and fifth lumbar vertebra; these effects were abolished at thermoneutral conditions. Mice housed at thermoneutral temperature had higher levels of bone formation in distal femur (based on histomorphometry) and globally (serum osteocalcin), and lower global levels of bone resorption (serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen) compared to mice housed at room temperature. Thermoneutral housing had no impact on bone marrow adiposity but resulted in higher abdominal white adipose tissue and serum leptin. The overall magnitude of room temperature housing-induced cancellous bone loss did not differ between male (current study) and female (published data) mice. These findings highlight housing temperature as a critical experimental variable in studies using mice of either sex to investigate aging-related changes in bone metabolism.

Effects of Spaceflight on Cancellous and Cortical Bone in Proximal Femur in Growing Rats,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7907224/,"Mechanical loading of the skeleton during normal weight bearing plays an important role in bone accrual and turnover balance. We recently evaluated bone microarchitecture in the femoral head in 5.6-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats subjected to a 4-day spaceflight aboard STS-41. Compared to weight bearing ground controls, cancellous bone volume fraction was dramatically lower in animals subjected to microgravity. The effects of spaceflight on the rat skeleton are potentially influenced by factors such as age, duration of flight, strain and sex. To test the generalizability of our initial observation, we evaluated archived proximal femora from two additional spaceflight missions: a 10-day mission (STS-57) with 7.5-week-old male Fisher 344 rats, and a 14-day mission (STS-62) with 12-week-old ovariectomized (ovx) female Fisher 344 rats. Cancellous microarchitecture and cortical thickness were assessed using x-ray microtomography/microcomputed tomography. In male rats, cancellous bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume) was lower in flight animals compared to flight controls, but differences were not significant compared to baseline. In ovx female rats, cancellous bone volume fraction was lower in flight animals compared to flight controls and baseline, indicating net bone loss. Cortical thickness did not differ among groups in either experiment. In summary, findings from three separate studies support the conclusion that spaceflight results in cancellous osteopenia in femoral head of growing rats.

Evidence for increased thermogenesis in female C57BL/6J mice housed aboard the international space station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8213760/,"Sixteen-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were sacrificed aboard the International Space Station after 37 days of flight (RR-1 mission) and frozen carcasses returned to Earth. RNA was isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) and gonadal white adipose tissue (WAT). Spaceflight resulted in differential expression of genes in BAT consistent with increased non-shivering thermogenesis and differential expression of genes in WAT consistent with increased glucose uptake and metabolism, adipogenesis, and β-oxidation.

Mice are facultative daily heterotherms and, in contrast to humans who maintain a near constant core body temperature over a wide range of environmental temperatures, mice can experience dramatic transient reductions in core temperature (torpor) when exposed to temperatures below thermoneutral 1 , 2 . Because of their small mass, mice are much more dependent on shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis for maintaining core body temperature than larger animals 3 .
The recommended temperature for housing mice in a laboratory setting (20–26 °C) is well below their thermoneutral zone, which depending upon strain, sex and age typically ranges from 29–31 °C 4 . Subthermoneutral housing induces adaptive responses in mice to increase generation of heat 5 . These adaptations include shivering thermogenesis, non-shivering thermogenesis, thermic effect of increased food consumption and physical activity. Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) neurotransmitters (norepinephrine and epinephrine) and the adipokine leptin are key factors involved in regulation of adaptive thermogenesis 6 , 7 . Subthermoneutral-housed mice use a variety of physiological and behavioral strategies to decrease their requirements for adaptive thermogenesis. These include entering torpor to lower core body temperature, and nest building, huddling and postural changes to minimize heat loss when exposed to a cool environment 8 , 9 .
The physiological demands required for successful adaptation to subthermoneutral housing by mice are considerable; for example, female mice housed at room temperature (22 °C) consumed 40% more food to achieve comparable weight gain and expressed 5-fold higher Ucp1 gene expression in BAT (non-shivering thermogenesis) compared to thermoneutral-housed (32 °C) mice 10 . UCP-1 protein uncouples oxidative phosphorylation to produce heat instead of ATP. Extensive research supports the conclusion that by increasing UCP-1 protein levels, sympathetic signaling-driven non-shivering thermogenesis plays an important role in cold-induced thermoregulation in mice.
We hypothesize that spaceflight reduces the ability of mice to employ some of the strategies used to minimize adaptive thermogenesis, such as huddling and postural adjustments, resulting in an increased dependence on adaptive thermogenesis to maintain core body temperature. Group housing attenuates the increase in non-shivering thermogenesis in BAT in mice exposed to a cool environment 11 but it is plausible that another aspect of the spaceflight environment increases sympathetic signaling, an important positive regulator of thermogenesis. Whatever the precise mechanism, increased thermogenesis is important because it influences multiple physiological processes 12 – 15 . Collateral changes associated with increased thermogenesis include cancellous bone loss, immune suppression, increases in glucocorticoid production, increases in blood pressure and heart rate, and altered tumor and tissue response to ionizing radiation 16 – 18 . Mechanistically, at least some of these responses are mediated by increased sympathetic outflow 14 , 19 , 20 .
Thus, activation of adaptive thermogenesis in mice housed in microgravity may introduce unrecognized and uncontrolled for confounding variables into spaceflight studies. We tested the hypothesis that nonshivering thermogenesis is increased in mice during spaceflight by measuring the effect of spaceflight on expression of genes related to energy metabolism in BAT and WAT in female C57BL/6J (B6) mice. In contrast to most prior spaceflight studies where flight animals were returned to Earth, the animals in this experiment (RR-1) were sacrificed aboard the International Space Station (ISS), avoiding the influence of restoration of normal gravitational loading.
Temperatures during the spaceflight mission ranged from a low of 21.3 °C to a high of 28.0 °C. The average housing temperatures within the Habitats enclosing the mice aboard ISS were 26.0 °C and 26.4 °C for flight and ground control animals, respectively. These housing temperatures, while above temperatures commonly used to house mice, are below thermoneutral for this species. Weight gain did not differ, but activity levels were higher in the flight animals, as was food and water depletion 21 , findings consistent with increased adaptive thermogenesis.
The effect of the spaceflight environment on differential expression of genes related to energy metabolism in BAT in flight animals is shown in Table 1 . Transcript abundance of 13/84 genes were significantly altered in flight animals compared to ground controls. In particular, mice housed aboard ISS had 1.5x higher levels of Ucp-1 in BAT, providing direct evidence for elevated non-shivering thermogenesis. Several genes associated with adipogenesis and/or thermogenesis, including Adipoq , Ppargc1a, Cdkn1a 22 , and Cfd were differentially expressed in BAT during spaceflight 23 . However, these changes may reflect adaptation to long duration spaceflight. Regardless of the mechanisms for initiation, increased Ucp1 -mediated thermogenesis in BAT may have had a major impact on adipose tissue turnover in WAT (Table 2 ). Transcript abundance of 30/84 genes were significantly altered in flight animals compared to ground controls. Notable changes, including higher expression levels for (1) Acacb (Acetyl-CoA carboxylase), a key gene in regulation of fatty acid oxidation, (2) Dio2 (Type II iodothyronine deiodinase), a key regulator of thyroid hormone action, (3) Sic2a4 (Glut 4), an insulin-regulated glucose transporter, and (4) Fasn (fatty acid synthase) which catalyzes the synthesis of palmitate, were observed in WAT of flight animals. There was also evidence for induction of Ucp-1 ; expression level for this gene was very low (Ct > 30) in ground control mice and consistently detected in flight mice (Ct < 30), suggesting browning of WAT 24 . We conclude from these findings that, in spite of comparable housing temperatures, adaptive thermogenesis is increased in BAT of mice housed aboard the ISS compared to ground controls. This is important because increased thermogenesis may exaggerate (e.g., bone loss) or alter (e.g., response to ionizing radiation) physiological responses to spaceflight in mice. Because of species specific differences in thermoregulation, this could impact the translatability of the animal studies to astronauts.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-npjmicrogr.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Leptin and environmental temperature as determinants of bone marrow adiposity in female mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9582271/,"Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) levels are higher in distal femur metaphysis of female mice housed at thermoneutral (32°C) than in mice housed at 22°C, as are abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) mass, and serum leptin levels. We performed two experiments to explore the role of increased leptin in temperature-enhanced accrual of BMAT. First, we supplemented 6-week-old female C57BL/6J (B6) mice with leptin for 2 weeks at 10 µg/d using a subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump. Controls consisted of ad libitum ( ad lib ) fed mice and mice pair fed to match food intake of leptin-supplemented mice. The mice were maintained at 32°C for the duration of treatment. At necropsy, serum leptin in leptin-supplemented mice did not differ from ad lib mice, suggesting suppression of endogenous leptin production. In support, Ucp1 expression in BAT, percent body fat, and abdominal WAT mass were lower in leptin-supplemented mice. Leptin-supplemented mice also had lower BMAT and higher bone formation in distal femur metaphysis compared to the ad lib group, changes not replicated by pair-feeding. In the second experiment, BMAT response was evaluated in 6-week-old female B6 wild type (WT), leptin-deficient ob/ob and leptin-treated (0.3 μg/d) ob/ob mice housed at 32°C for the 2-week duration of the treatment. Compared to mice sacrificed at baseline (22°C), BMAT increased in ob/ob mice as well as WT mice, indicating a leptin independent response to increased temperature. However, infusion of ob/ob mice with leptin, at a dose rate having negligible effects on either energy metabolism or serum leptin levels, attenuated the increase in BMAT. In summary, increased housing temperature and increased leptin have independent but opposing effects on BMAT in mice.

Small changes in thermoregulation influence cancellous bone turnover balance in distal femur metaphysis in growing female mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10063413/,"Mice are typically housed at temperatures well below their thermoneutral zone. When individually housed at room temperature (~22 °C) mice experience cold stress which results in cancellous bone loss and has the potential to alter the skeletal response to treatment. It is not clear if there is a threshold temperature for cold stress-induced bone loss. It is also not clear if alternative strategies for attenuating cold stress, such as group housing, influence bone accrual and turnover. This study aimed to determine how small differences in temperature (4 °C) or heat loss (individual versus group housing with nestlets) influence bone in growing female C57BL/6 J mice. Five-week-old mice were randomized by weight to 1 of 4 treatment groups (N = 10/group): 1) baseline, 2) single housed at 22 °C, 3) single housed at 26 °C, or 4) group housed (n = 5/cage) with nestlets at 22 °C. Mice in the baseline group were sacrificed 1 week later, at 6 weeks of age. The other 3 groups of mice were maintained at their respective temperatures and housing conditions for 13 weeks until 18 weeks of age. Compared to baseline, mice single housed at room temperature had increased body weight and femur size, but dramatically decreased cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis. The cancellous bone loss was attenuated but not prevented in mice individually housed at 26 °C or group housed at 22 °C. In conclusion, by impacting thermogenesis or heat loss, modest differences in housing conditions could influence experimental results.

Bone Marrow Adipose Tissue Is Not Required for Reconstitution of the Immune System Following Irradiation in Male Mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10889206/,"Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is hypothesized to serve as an expandable/contractible fat depot which functions, in part, to minimize energy requirements for sustaining optimal hematopoiesis. We investigated whether BMAT is required for immune reconstitution following injury. Male wild type (WBB6F1, WT) and BMAT-deficient WBB6F1/J- Kit W /Kit W-v /J ( Kit W/W-v ) mice were lethally irradiated. Irradiation was followed by adoptive transfer of 1000 purified WT hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The extent of immune reconstitution in blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes in the irradiated mice was determined using HSCs from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing mice. We also evaluated skeletal response to treatment. Detection of GFP-positive B and T cells in peripheral blood at 4 and 9 weeks following adoptive transfer and in bone marrow and lymph nodes following necropsy revealed excellent immune reconstitution in both WT and BMAT-deficient mice. Adipocytes were numerous in the distal femur of WT mice but absent or rare in Kit W/W-v mice. Bone parameters, including length, mass, density, bone volume, microarchitecture, and turnover balance, exhibited few differences between WT and BMAT-deficient mice. The minimal differences suggest that BMAT is not required for reconstitution of the immune system following lethal radiation and is not a major contributor to the skeletal phenotypes of kit signaling-deficient mice.

Simulated Microgravity Promotes Horizontal Gene Transfer of Antimicrobial Resistance Genes between Bacterial Genera in the Absence of Antibiotic Selective Pressure,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8468678/,"Bacteria are able to adapt and survive in harsh and changing environments through many mechanisms, with one of them being horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This process is one of the leading culprits in the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within bacterial communities and could pose a significant health threat to astronauts if they fell ill, especially on long-duration space missions. In order to better understand the degree of HGT activity that could occur in space, biosafety level-2, donor and recipient bacteria were co-cultured under simulated microgravity (SMG) on Earth with concomitant 1G controls. Two AMR genes, bla OXA-500 and ISAba1, from the donor Acinetobacter pittii, were tracked in four recipient strains of Staphylococcus aureus (which did not harbor those genes) using polymerase chain reaction. All four S. aureus strains that were co-cultured with A. pittii under SMG had a significantly higher number of isolates that were now bla OXA-500 - and ISAba1 -positive compared to growth at 1G. The acquisition of these genes by the recipient induced a phenotypic change, as these isolates were now resistant to oxacillin, which they were previously susceptible to. This is a novel study, presenting, for the first time, increased HGT activity under SMG and the potential impact of the space environment in promoting increased gene dissemination within bacterial communities.

Understanding the Complexities and Changes of the Astronaut Microbiome for Successful Long-Duration Space Missions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9031868/,"During space missions, astronauts are faced with a variety of challenges that are unique to spaceflight and that have been known to cause physiological changes in humans over a period of time. Several of these changes occur at the microbiome level, a complex ensemble of microbial communities residing in various anatomic sites of the human body, with a pivotal role in regulating the health and behavior of the host. The microbiome is essential for day-to-day physiological activities, and alterations in microbiome composition and function have been linked to various human diseases. For these reasons, understanding the impact of spaceflight and space conditions on the microbiome of astronauts is important to assess significant health risks that can emerge during long-term missions and to develop countermeasures. Here, we review various conditions that are caused by long-term space exploration and discuss the role of the microbiome in promoting or ameliorating these conditions, as well as space-related factors that impact microbiome composition. The topics explored pertain to microgravity, radiation, immunity, bone health, cognitive function, gender differences and pharmacomicrobiomics. Connections are made between the trifecta of spaceflight, the host and the microbiome, and the significance of these interactions for successful long-term space missions.

Roll maneuvers are essential for active reorientation of Caenorhabditis elegans in 3D media,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5910807/,"Locomotion of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a key observable used in investigations ranging from behavior to neuroscience to aging. However, while the natural environment of this model organism is 3D, quantitative investigations of its locomotion have been mostly limited to 2D motion. Here, we present a quantitative analysis of how the nematode reorients itself in 3D media. We identify a unique behavioral state of C. elegans —a roll maneuver—which is an essential component of 3D locomotion in burrowing and swimming. The rolls, associated with nonzero torsion of the nematode body, result in rotation of the plane of dorsoventral body undulations about the symmetry axis of the trajectory. When combined with planar turns in a new undulation plane, the rolls allow the nematode to reorient its body in any direction, thus enabling complete exploration of 3D space. The rolls observed in swimming are much faster than the ones in burrowing; we show that this difference stems from a purely hydrodynamic enhancement mechanism and not from a gait change or an increase in the body torsion. This result demonstrates that hydrodynamic viscous forces can enhance 3D reorientation in undulatory locomotion, in contrast to known hydrodynamic hindrance of both forward motion and planar turns.
Investigations of locomotion of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can provide a wealth of knowledge on physiology, muscle biology, and neural control of movement and behavior. Locomotion depends on muscular strength ( 1 – 3 ), neuromuscular coordination ( 4 , 5 ), and processing of information from sensory inputs ( 6 , 7 ). Locomotory readouts are thus extensively used to quantify effects of genetic mutations ( 8 – 10 ), exercise, nutrition, and environmental factors ( 11 – 17 ) and to evaluate pharmacological impacts ( 18 , 19 ).
In its natural environment (soil rich in decaying organic matter), C. elegans interacts with a complex 3D surrounding medium that includes soft organic materials and rainwater ( 20 , 21 ). Most studies of nematode locomotion, however, have focused on 2D motion ( 22 – 32 ), and little effort has been made to characterize worm motility in 3D environments.
Only recently was 3D burrowing motion of C. elegans in soft substrates stereoscopically imaged ( 33 ) and a statistical analysis of basic locomotory parameters reported ( 34 ); it was also shown that a burrowing nematode can reorient itself in response to external stimuli ( 34 , 35 ). Furthermore, feasibility of using 3D motion to assess genetic mutations ( 36 ) and to identify muscular dystrophy ( 34 ) was experimentally demonstrated.
Such 3D methods of scoring C. elegans locomotory behavior can achieve better sensitivity than screens based on 2D observations alone. However, unleashing the full potential of these promising techniques requires complementary efforts to identify specific behavioral patterns associated with 3D reorientation maneuvers. A thorough quantitative understanding of 3D gait geometry and mechanics is also important for gaining insights into mechanisms of neuromuscular actuation of body movements and for development of next-generation software packages for automated tracking and analysis of nematode behavior.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-pnas.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ac9e/5910807/9d7a1e77cf3a/pnas.1706754115fig01.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ac9e/5910807/d19e7ee1b5b4/pnas.1706754115fig02.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ac9e/5910807/766a785745bd/pnas.1706754115fig03.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ac9e/5910807/2b9b58701c84/pnas.1706754115fig04.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ac9e/5910807/db78fb812b0b/pnas.1706754115fig05.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ac9e/5910807/74a2172ff7a0/pnas.1706754115fig06.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ac9e/5910807/7f52d45eea26/pnas.1706754115fig07.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ac9e/5910807/7197cca350f2/pnas.1706754115fig08.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ac9e/5910807/0298425ddf69/pnas.1706754115fig09.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ac9e/5910807/ee0bc1cecc56/pnas.1706754115fig10.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/ac9e/5910807/bb63abbe3fbd/pnas.1706754115fig11.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Microfluidic Device for Studying Nematodes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12021249/,"The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been routinely used to study gene functions, genetic interactions, and conserved signaling pathways. Most experiments require that the animals are synchronized to be at the same specific developmental stage. Bleach synchronization is traditionally used to obtain a population of staged embryos, but the method can have harmful effects on the embryos. The physical separation of differently sized animals is preferred but often difficult to perform because some developmental stages are the same sizes as others. Microfluidic device filters have been used as alternatives, but they are expensive and require customization to scale up the preparation of staged animals. Here, we present a protocol for the synchronization of embryos using mesh filters. Using filtration, we obtained a higher yield of embryos per plate than using the standard bleach synchronization protocol and at a scale beyond microfluidic devices. Importantly, filtration has no deleterious effects on downstream larval development assays. In conclusion, we have exploited the differences in the sizes of C. elegans developmental stages to isolate embryo cultures suitable for use in high-throughput assays.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6541/12021249/d251fb7f08aa/pone.0318143.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6541/12021249/a4bc6142165b/pone.0318143.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6541/12021249/6007096d7751/pone.0318143.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6541/12021249/f6ee65014e1d/pone.0318143.g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6541/12021249/eac18d65e6fe/pone.0318143.g005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6541/12021249/085fab9cf711/pone.0318143.g006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6541/12021249/b0be10f768c1/pone.0318143.g007.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
NemaFlex: A microfluidics-based technology for standardized measurement of muscular strength of C. elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6057834/,"Muscle strength is a functional measure of quality of life in humans. Declines in muscle strength are manifested in diseases as well as during inactivity, aging, and space travel. With conserved muscle biology, the simple genetic model C. elegans is a high throughput platform in which to identify molecular mechanisms causing muscle strength loss and to develop interventions based on diet, exercise, and drugs. In the clinic, standardized strength measures are essential to quantitate changes in patients; however, analogous standards have not been recapitulated in the C. elegans model since force generation fluctuates based on animal behavior and locomotion. Here, we report a microfluidics-based system for strength measurement that we call ‘NemaFlex’, based on pillar deflection as the nematode crawls through a forest of pillars. We have optimized the micropillar forest design and identified robust measurement conditions that yield a measure of strength that is independent of behavior and gait. Validation studies using a muscle contracting agent and mutants confirm that NemaFlex can reliably score muscular strength in C. elegans . Additionally, we report a scaling factor to account for animal size that is consistent with a biomechanics model and enables comparative strength studies of mutants. Taken together, our findings anchor NemaFlex for applications in genetic and drug screens, for defining molecular and cellular circuits of neuromuscular function, and for dissection of degenerative processes in disuse, aging, and disease.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-nihpa.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fe4c/6057834/d982fddcb678/nihms974538u1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fe4c/6057834/3b2ef5fdcfdd/nihms974538f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fe4c/6057834/97cc31f8a1e1/nihms974538f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fe4c/6057834/ac6cf31b2e3e/nihms974538f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fe4c/6057834/61ec70614d6c/nihms974538f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fe4c/6057834/73b532993fd4/nihms974538f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fe4c/6057834/a4e8f3f1160d/nihms974538f6.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fe4c/6057834/2a8bd3cf318c/nihms974538f7.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fe4c/6057834/53ac9162036b/nihms974538f8.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fe4c/6057834/fba4edd51bc1/nihms974538f9.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fe4c/6057834/c93ecf502b1a/nihms974538f10.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fe4c/6057834/d1200afce0e1/nihms974538f11.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/fe4c/6057834/5049dd32bc43/nihms974538f12.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
"Swim exercise in Caenorhabditis elegans extends neuromuscular and gut healthspan, enhances learning ability, and protects against neurodegeneration",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6876156/,"Regular physical exercise is the most efficient and accessible intervention known to promote healthy aging in humans. The molecular and cellular mechanisms that mediate system-wide exercise benefits, however, remain poorly understood, especially as applies to tissues that do not participate directly in training activity. The establishment of exercise protocols for short-lived genetic models will be critical for deciphering fundamental mechanisms of transtissue exercise benefits to healthy aging. Here we document optimization of a long-term swim exercise protocol for Caenorhabditis elegans and we demonstrate its benefits to diverse aging tissues, even if exercise occurs only during a restricted phase of adulthood. We found that multiple daily swim sessions are essential for exercise adaptation, leading to body wall muscle improvements in structural gene expression, locomotory performance, and mitochondrial morphology. Swim exercise training enhances whole-animal health parameters, such as mitochondrial respiration and midlife survival, increases functional healthspan of the pharynx and intestine, and enhances nervous system health by increasing learning ability and protecting against neurodegeneration in models of tauopathy, Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. Remarkably, swim training only during early adulthood induces long-lasting systemic benefits that in several cases are still detectable well into midlife. Our data reveal the broad impact of swim exercise in promoting extended healthspan of multiple C. elegans tissues, underscore the potency of early exercise experience to influence long-term health, and establish the foundation for exploiting the powerful advantages of this genetic model for the dissection of the exercise-dependent molecular circuitry that confers system-wide health benefits to aging adults.
Physical inactivity is a worldwide public health problem. Globally, more than 5 million premature deaths each year (∼9%) may be attributable to insufficient physical activity ( 1 ). Conversely, it is striking that exercise provides widespread health benefits, including protection against cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and against age-associated declines in muscle, immune, and cognitive function ( 2 , 3 ). Given the overwhelming projected social and economic costs of caring for the growing inactive and elderly populations, defining how activity and exercise physiology promote healthier aging is of critical importance. Unfortunately, however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that mediate systemic exercise benefits remain poorly understood. This gap in knowledge is partially due to the lack of established short-lived genetic models in which fundamental questions on transtissue exercise signaling can be evaluated over the entire aging process. Importantly, exercise training in Drosophila improves motility, cardiac performance, and mitochondrial health ( 4 – 6 ), supporting that exercise adaptation is conserved from invertebrates to humans, and opening the door to the exploitation of powerful invertebrate model systems for mechanistic dissection of health benefit circuits in exercise biology.
The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a genetic model widely used in aging and stress research that holds great potential to unlock the molecular circuitry involved in exercise-dependent systemic health benefits. The short lifespan (about 3 wk) makes C. elegans a desirable model with which to assess exercise effects over the entire adult lifetime. C. elegans reach adulthood in ∼2.5 d and self-reproduce for approximately the first 6 d of adult life ( 7 ). The reduction in reproductive capacity is accompanied by age-related decline in multiple tissues and functions over the next several days, including locomotion, muscle structure, pharyngeal pumping, intestinal integrity, and neuronally controlled actions ( 7 – 11 ). The aging C. elegans body wall muscle exhibits nuclear fragmentation, mitochondrial network and sarcomere disorganization, lipid accumulation, and loss of muscle mass ( 8 , 12 ), resembling the fundamental characteristics of human sarcopenia (the pervasive age-associated loss of muscle strength and muscle mass that contributes to human frailty).
We have shown previously that swimming in a liquid environment is more energetically demanding for C. elegans than the crawling motion on agar plates used in standard laboratory growth protocols ( 13 ). Moreover, we showed that a single 90-min C. elegans swim session induces key features of mammalian exercise, namely locomotory fatigue, muscle mitochondrial oxidation, a transcriptional oxidative stress response, and changes in carbohydrate and fat metabolism ( 13 ). Hartman et al. ( 14 ) found that a 6-d swim exercise regimen in C. elegans improves body wall muscle mitochondrial morphology, changes mitochondrial respiration parameters, and protects against acute exposure to the mito-toxicants rotenone and arsenic. Other exercise paradigms in C. elegans have been described ( 15 – 18 ), with a focus on body wall muscle- and mitochondrial-related phenotypes. However, exercise-dependent effects on a wider range of C. elegans tissues (i.e., systemic benefits of exercise to nonmuscle tissue and their potential extension into older adult health) remain mostly undescribed.
Here, we report on the optimization of a long-term swim exercise protocol for C. elegans and establish that multiple daily swim sessions are essential for exercise adaptation that includes increased muscle gene expression, improved locomotory performance, and enhanced maintenance of the muscle mitochondrial network. Whole-animal parameters, such as mitochondrial respiration and midlife survival, are also improved by exercise. Importantly, we show that swim exercise improves pharyngeal, intestinal, and neuronal functions. Furthermore, we find that neurodegenerative pathological conditions in C. elegans models of tauopathy, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and Huntington’s disease (HD) are ameliorated by swim exercise training. The systemic exercise effects we describe reveal a broad impact of swim training on C. elegans physiology and establish the critical groundwork for future dissection of the molecular circuitry responsible for exercise-dependent transtissue health benefits.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-pnas.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f4d5/6876156/62c46ac573bc/pnas.1909210116fig01.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f4d5/6876156/72a78043cb62/pnas.1909210116fig02.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f4d5/6876156/70e66e166e18/pnas.1909210116fig03.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f4d5/6876156/2838a7ab3f7b/pnas.1909210116fig04.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f4d5/6876156/c894ec0e1983/pnas.1909210116fig05.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f4d5/6876156/729b53464beb/pnas.1909210116fig06.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f4d5/6876156/5af0a8562e4a/pnas.1909210116fig07.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Molecular muscle experiment: Hardware and operational lessons for future astrobiology space experiments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7415877/,"Biology experiments in space seek to increase our understanding of what happens to life beyond Earth and how we can safely send life beyond Earth. Spaceflight is associated with many (mal)adaptations in physiology, including decline in musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, vestibular, and immune systems. Biological experiments in space are inherently challenging to implement. Development of hardware and validation of experimental conditions are critical to ensure the collection of high-quality data. The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans has been studied in space for more than 20 years to better understand spaceflight-induced (patho)physiology, particularly spaceflight-induced muscle decline. These experiments have used a variety of hardware configurations. Despite this, hardware used in the past was not available for our most recent experiment, the Molecular Muscle Experiment (MME). Therefore, we had to design and validate flight hardware for MME. MME provides a contemporary example of many of the challenges faced by researchers conducting C. elegans experiments onboard the International Space Station. Here, we describe the hardware selection and validation, in addition to the ground-based experiment scientific validation testing. These experiences and operational solutions allow others to replicate and/or improve our experimental design on future missions.

Tart Cherry Increases Lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans by Altering Metabolic Signaling Pathways,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7285199/,"Aging and healthspan are determined by both environmental and genetic factors. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) pathway is a key mediator of aging in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals. Specifically, DAF-2 signaling, an ortholog of human IGF, controls DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, a master regulator of metabolism and longevity. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are both linked to aging. We propose that daily supplementation of tart cherry extract (TCE), rich in anthocyanins with antioxidant properties may exert dual benefits for mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, resulting in beneficial effects on aging in C. elegans . We found that TCE supplementation at 6 μg or 12 μg/mL, increased ( p < 0.05) the mean lifespan of wild type N2 worms, respectively, when compared to untreated control worms. Consistent with these findings, TCE upregulated ( p < 0.05) expression of longevity-related genes such as daf-16 and aak-2 (but not daf-2 or akt-1 genes) and genes related to oxidative stress such as sod-2 . Further, we showed that TCE supplementation increased spare respiration in N2 worms. However, TCE did not change the mean lifespan of daf-16 and aak-2 mutant worms. In conclusion, our findings indicate that TCE confers healthspan benefits in C. elegans through enhanced mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress, mainly via the DAF-16 pathway.

A region of UNC-89 (obscurin) lying between two protein kinase domains is a highly elastic spring required for proper sarcomere organization,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9549344/,"In C. elegans , unc-89 encodes a set of giant multi-domain proteins (up 8,081 residues) localized to the M-lines of muscle sarcomeres and required for normal sarcomere organization and whole-animal locomotion. Multiple UNC-89 isoforms contain two protein kinase domains. There is conservation in arrangement of domains between UNC-89 and its two mammalian homologs, obscurin and SPEG: kinase, a non-domain region of 647–742 residues, Ig domain, Fn3 domain and a second kinase domain. In all three proteins, this non-domain “interkinase region” has low sequence complexity, high proline content and lacks predicted secondary structure. We report that a major portion of this interkinase (571 residues out of 647 residues) when examined by single molecule force spectroscopy in vitro displays the properties of a random coil and acts as an entropic spring. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create nematodes carrying an in-frame deletion of the same 571-residue portion of the interkinase. These animals display severe disorganization of all portions of the sarcomere in body wall muscle. Super-resolution microscopy reveals extra, short-A-bands lying close to the outer muscle cell membrane and between normally spaced A-bands. Nematodes with this in-frame deletion show defective locomotion and muscle force generation. We designed our CRISPR-generated in-frame deletion to contain an HA tag at the N-terminus of the large UNC-89 isoforms. This HA tag results in normal organization of body wall muscle, but approximately half the normal levels of the giant UNC-89 isoforms, dis-organization of pharyngeal muscle, small body size, and reduced muscle force, likely due to poor nutritional uptake.

NemaLife chip: a micropillar-based microfluidic culture device optimized for aging studies in crawling C. elegans,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7530743/,"In this study, we report a microfluidic device for the whole-life culture of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that allows the scoring of animal survival and health measures. This device referred to as the NemaLife chip features: (1) an optimized micropillar arena in which animals can crawl, (2) sieve channels that separate progeny and prevent the loss of adults from the arena during culture maintenance, and (3) ports that allow rapid accessibility for feeding the adult-only population and introducing reagents as needed. The pillar arena geometry was optimized to accommodate the growing body size during culture and emulate the body gait and locomotion of animals reared on agar. Likewise, feeding protocols were optimized to recapitulate longevity outcomes typical of standard plate growth. Key benefits of the NemaLife Chip include eliminating the need to perform repeated manual transfers of adults during survival assays, negating the need for progeny-blocking chemical interventions, and avoiding the swim-induced stress across lifespan in animals reared in liquid. We also show that the culture of animals in pillar-less microfluidic chambers reduces lifespan and introduces physiological stress by increasing the occurrence of age-related vulval integrity disorder. We validated our pillar-based device with longevity analyses of classical aging mutants ( daf-2 , age-1 , eat-2, and daf-16 ) and animals subjected to RNAi knockdown of age-related genes ( age-1 and daf-16 ). We also showed that healthspan measures such as pharyngeal pumping and tap-induced stimulated reversals can be scored across the lifespan in the NemaLife chip. Overall, the capacity to generate reliable lifespan and physiological data underscores the potential of the NemaLife chip to accelerate healthspan and lifespan investigations in C. elegans .

Microfluidics-integrated spaceflight hardware for measuring muscle strength of Caenorhabditis elegans on the International Space Station.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9640571/,"Caenorhabditis elegans is a low-cost genetic model that has been flown to the International Space Station to investigate the influence of microgravity on changes in the expression of genes involved in muscle maintenance. These studies showed that genes that encode muscle attachment complexes have decreased expression under microgravity. However, it remains to be answered whether the decreased expression leads to concomitant changes in animal muscle strength, specifically across multiple generations. We recently reported the NemaFlex microfluidic device for the measurement of muscle strength of C. elegans (Rahman et al., Lab Chip, 2018). In this study, we redesign our original NemaFlex device and integrate it with flow control hardware for spaceflight investigations considering mixed animal culture, constraints on astronaut time, crew safety, and on-orbit operations. The technical advances we have made include (i) a microfluidic device design that allows animals of a given size to be sorted from unsynchronized cultures and housed in individual chambers, (ii) a fluid handling protocol for injecting the suspension of animals into the microfluidic device that prevents channel clogging, introduction of bubbles, and crowding of animals in the chambers, and (iii) a custom-built worm-loading apparatus interfaced with the microfluidic device that allows easy manipulation of the worm suspension and prevents fluid leakage into the surrounding environment. Collectively, these technical advances enabled the development of new microfluidics-integrated hardware for spaceflight studies in C. elegans . Finally, we report Earth-based validation studies to test this new hardware, which has led to it being flown to the International Space Station.

A Compact Imaging Platform for Conducting C. elegans Phenotypic Assays on Earth and in Spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9862956/,"The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans is used in a variety of applications ranging from fundamental biological studies, to drug screening, to disease modeling, and to space-biology investigations. These applications rely on conducting whole-organism phenotypic assays involving animal behavior and locomotion. In this study, we report a 3D printed compact imaging platform (CIP) that is integrated with a smart-device camera for the whole-organism phenotyping of C. elegans . The CIP has no external optical elements and does not require mechanical focusing, simplifying the optical configuration. The small footprint of the system powered with a standard USB provides capabilities ranging from plug-and-play, to parallel operation, and to housing it in incubators for temperature control. We demonstrate on Earth the compatibility of the CIP with different C. elegans substrates, including agar plates, liquid droplets on glass slides and microfluidic chips. We validate the system with behavioral and thrashing assays and show that the phenotypic readouts are in good agreement with the literature data. We conduct a pilot study with mutants and show that the phenotypic data collected from the CIP distinguishes these mutants. Finally, we discuss how the simplicity and versatility offered by CIP makes it amenable to future C. elegans investigations on the International Space Station, where science experiments are constrained by system size, payload weight and crew time. Overall, the compactness, portability and ease-of-use makes the CIP desirable for research and educational outreach applications on Earth and in space.

Mitochondrial sulfide promotes life span and health span through distinct mechanisms in developing versus adult treated Caenorhabditis elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10410709/,"Living longer without simultaneously extending years spent in good health (“health span”) is an increasing societal burden, demanding new therapeutic strategies. Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) can correct disease-related mitochondrial metabolic deficiencies, and supraphysiological H 2 S concentrations can pro health span. However, the efficacy and mechanisms of mitochondrion-targeted sulfide delivery molecules (mtH 2 S) administered across the adult life course are unknown. Using a Caenorhabditis elegans aging model, we compared untargeted H 2 S (NaGYY4137, 100 µM and 100 nM) and mtH 2 S (AP39, 100 nM) donor effects on life span, neuromuscular health span, and mitochondrial integrity. H 2 S donors were administered from birth or in young/middle-aged animals (day 0, 2, or 4 postadulthood). RNAi pharmacogenetic interventions and transcriptomics/network analysis explored molecular events governing mtH 2 S donor-mediated health span. Developmentally administered mtH 2 S (100 nM) improved life/health span vs. equivalent untargeted H 2 S doses. mtH 2 S preserved aging mitochondrial structure, content (citrate synthase activity) and neuromuscular strength. Knockdown of H 2 S metabolism enzymes and FoxO/ daf-16 prevented the positive health span effects of mtH 2 S, whereas DCAF11/ wdr-23 – Nrf2/ skn-1 oxidative stress protection pathways were dispensable. Health span, but not life span, increased with all adult-onset mtH 2 S treatments. Adult mtH 2 S treatment also rejuvenated aging transcriptomes by minimizing expression declines of mitochondria and cytoskeletal components, and peroxisome metabolism hub components, under mechanistic control by the elt-6 / elt-3 transcription factor circuit. H 2 S health span extension likely acts at the mitochondrial level, the mechanisms of which dissociate from life span across adult vs. developmental treatment timings. The small mtH 2 S doses required for health span extension, combined with efficacy in adult animals, suggest mtH 2 S is a potential healthy aging therapeutic.
Medical advances mean humans are living longer but are also spending longer in a frail “poor health” state ( 1 , 2 ), with large burdens on healthcare systems and quality of life ( 3 ). Since most age-related healthcare costs and patient frailty occur in the later years of life ( 1 , 2 ), interventions that increase life span without simultaneously increasing health span would be detrimental to the aging process. Studies often report life span–extending therapeutics in lower organisms ( 4 , 5 ), but a significant caveat is the general assumption that increasing longevity also prolongs the duration spent in a healthy state (termed “health span”). While it is largely unknown whether most conditions that extend life span also increase health span, evidence indicates dissociation between the two ( 6 ). For example, all long-lived Caenorhabditis elegans mutants examined to date spend a longer time in an aged frail condition ( 7 ); the same phenomenon reported in long-living humans ( 1 , 2 ). Therapeutic approaches that extend healthy years, rather than life span alone, thus hold considerable socioeconomic potential.
Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) was one of the essential ingredients required for life to emerge on Earth ( 8 , 9 ) and has emerged as an important, physiologically relevant signaling molecule. When applied exogenously, H 2 S treatments, usually in the form of crude impure sulfide salts at supraphysiological concentrations (e.g. >100 µM), confer cytoprotective properties across various pathophysiological states ( 9 – 14 ), including age-associated diseases ( 15 , 16 ). Accordingly, 100 to 150 µM concentrations of untargeted H 2 S donors such as GYY4137 and FW1256 extend both life span ( 17 – 19 ) and health span ( 20 ) in C. elegans when administered from birth. However, several essential biochemical processes are established during development that program subsequent adult behavior. For example, developmental starvation cements locomotion circuitry that impacts adult foraging behavior ( 21 ), and developmentally established mitochondrial dynamics determine rates of adult respiration and aging ( 22 ). Additionally, life-extending mitochondrial interventions in C. elegans currently require administration on or before the developmental larval stages ( 23 ). Metabolic patterns set during developmental H 2 S treatments might, therefore, mediate life span and health span extension. The efficacy of H 2 S administered during “normal” stochastic aging thus warrants investigation to understand the viability of adult H 2 S-based therapies.
Several cellular processes are responsive to H 2 S that can regulate H 2 S-mediated longevity ( 18 ), yet the mechanisms governing H 2 S-mediated health span are undefined. Increasing evidence supports a mitochondrion-centric mode of H 2 S action across cell types and pathologies. Current dogma suggests H 2 S donates electrons to the mitochondrial electron transport chain, inhibits mitochondrial cAMP phosphodiesterases, facilitates mitochondrial DNA repair, promotes mitochondrial antioxidant protection, and augments mitochondrial respiration/ATP production (reviewed in ref. 24 ). Moreover, mitochondrial loss is one of the nine hallmarks of aging ( 25 ) and is the earliest detectable subcellular structural change during C. elegans aging ( 26 ), preceding physiological decline ( 27 ). As such, therapies that exploit positive H 2 S effects on mitochondria represent an attractive antiaging strategy. The mitochondrial sulfide delivery molecule (mtH 2 S), AP39, exploits mitochondrial membrane potential by utilizing a TPP + motif to localize H 2 S to the mitochondria and protect against cellular injury [e.g., glucose oxidase–induced mitochondrial dysfunction ( 28 )] vs. equal doses of untargeted H 2 S donors. Consequently, unlike untargeted H 2 S compounds (e.g., GYY4137, FW1256) with supraphysiological effective doses ( 17 – 20 ), mtH 2 S displays potency at concentrations several orders of magnitude lower in C. elegans disease models ( 13 , 14 ). Whether such phenomena occur in the aging context is unknown; however, mtH 2 S is plausibly responsible for longevity and health span extension reported following larger untargeted H 2 S doses.
This study, therefore, investigated the efficacy of a mtH 2 S (AP39) for promoting health span via mitochondrion-mediated effects vs. untargeted H 2 S donors, using C. elegans as an aging model. Given the unknown capacity of H 2 S as an efficacious therapy in aging adults, we also examined health span effects of adult-onset H 2 S treatments. Using functional pharmacogenetic approaches, we provide evidence that mtH 2 S is a requirement for, and site of action of, H 2 S-mediated health span promotion. Importantly, mtH 2 S increases health span when administered to young and middle-aged adults, and this adult treatment effect is clearly reflected at the transcriptomic level compared to developmental mtH 2 S administration, under the control of a GATA family of transcription factors. These findings strongly suggest that augmentation of mitochondrial sulfide may represent a druggable target and translatable therapeutic approach to maintaining health with advancing age, at time points where the negative effects of aging already manifest.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-pnas.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/37f2/10410709/86bf7a9c11b8/pnas.2216141120fig01.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/37f2/10410709/81d2a0785b6a/pnas.2216141120fig02.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/37f2/10410709/03c7800f5280/pnas.2216141120fig03.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/37f2/10410709/e7043dbec1e5/pnas.2216141120fig04.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/37f2/10410709/899e9acd8ef7/pnas.2216141120fig05.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/37f2/10410709/e201c0b099d1/pnas.2216141120fig06.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

Spaceflight Induces Strength Decline in Caenorhabditis elegans,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10605753/,"Background: Understanding and countering the well-established negative health consequences of spaceflight remains a primary challenge preventing safe deep space exploration. Targeted/personalized therapeutics are at the forefront of space medicine strategies, and cross-species molecular signatures now define the ‘typical’ spaceflight response. However, a lack of direct genotype–phenotype associations currently limits the robustness and, therefore, the therapeutic utility of putative mechanisms underpinning pathological changes in flight. Methods: We employed the worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a validated model of space biology, combined with ‘NemaFlex-S’ microfluidic devices for assessing animal strength production as one of the most reproducible physiological responses to spaceflight. Wild-type and dys-1 (BZ33) strains (a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) model for comparing predisposed muscle weak animals) were cultured on the International Space Station in chemically defined media before loading second-generation gravid adults into NemaFlex-S devices to assess individual animal strength. These same cultures were then frozen on orbit before returning to Earth for next-generation sequencing transcriptomic analysis. Results: Neuromuscular strength was lower in flight versus ground controls (16.6% decline, p < 0.05), with dys-1 significantly more (23% less strength, p < 0.01) affected than wild types. The transcriptional gene ontology signatures characterizing both strains of weaker animals in flight strongly corroborate previous results across species, enriched for upregulated stress response pathways and downregulated mitochondrial and cytoskeletal processes. Functional gene cluster analysis extended this to implicate decreased neuronal function, including abnormal calcium handling and acetylcholine signaling, in space-induced strength declines under the predicted control of UNC-89 and DAF-19 transcription factors. Finally, gene modules specifically altered in dys-1 animals in flight again cluster to neuronal/neuromuscular pathways, suggesting strength loss in DMD comprises a strong neuronal component that predisposes these animals to exacerbated strength loss in space. Conclusions: Highly reproducible gene signatures are strongly associated with space-induced neuromuscular strength loss across species and neuronal changes in calcium/acetylcholine signaling require further study. These results promote targeted medical efforts towards and provide an in vivo model for safely sending animals and people into deep space in the near future.

Protein kinase 2 of the giant sarcomeric protein UNC-89 regulates mitochondrial morphology and function,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11487192/,"UNC-89 is a giant sarcomeric M-line protein required for sarcomere organization and optimal muscle function. UNC-89 contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and PK2, separated by an elastic region. Here we show that PK2 is a canonical kinase expected to be catalytically active. C. elegans expressing UNC-89 with a lysine to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria, correlated with more mitochondrially-associated DRP-1. PK2 KtoA mutants have increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis and altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. Muscle mitochondria show increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration, each of which cannot be uncoupled. This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting from an increased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria, to help match energy requirements with energy production.

UNC-89, a giant protein localized to muscle sarcomeres, contains 2 protein kinase domains, one of which, PK2 is a canonical kinase. A missense mutation expected to inactivate PK2 results in worms with an unexpected phenotype suggesting signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-commbiol.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6387/11487192/e05384b9dc63/42003_2024_7042_Fig1_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6387/11487192/879791502265/42003_2024_7042_Fig2_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6387/11487192/39c57371fcb1/42003_2024_7042_Fig3_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6387/11487192/e2e18ed8bd9c/42003_2024_7042_Fig4_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6387/11487192/26076a9cb236/42003_2024_7042_Fig5_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6387/11487192/a703c30eff38/42003_2024_7042_Fig6_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6387/11487192/2389fb7c0bd3/42003_2024_7042_Fig7_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6387/11487192/bc8f743a06cc/42003_2024_7042_Fig8_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6387/11487192/295e34c41b29/42003_2024_7042_Fig9_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6387/11487192/bae3d3c2447e/42003_2024_7042_Fig10_HTML.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
New perspectives on viable microbial communities in low-biomass cleanroom environments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3554398/,"The advent of phylogenetic DNA microarrays and high-throughput pyrosequencing technologies has dramatically increased the resolution and accuracy of detection of distinct microbial lineages in mixed microbial assemblages. Despite an expanding array of approaches for detecting microbes in a given sample, rapid and robust means of assessing the differential viability of these cells, as a function of phylogenetic lineage, remain elusive. In this study, pre-PCR propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment was coupled with downstream pyrosequencing and PhyloChip DNA microarray analyses to better understand the frequency, diversity and distribution of viable bacteria in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms. Sample fractions not treated with PMA, which were indicative of the presence of both live and dead cells, yielded a great abundance of highly diverse bacterial pyrosequences. In contrast, only 1% to 10% of all of the pyrosequencing reads, arising from a few robust bacterial lineages, originated from sample fractions that had been pre-treated with PMA. The results of PhyloChip analyses of PMA-treated and -untreated sample fractions were in agreement with those of pyrosequencing. The viable bacterial population detected in cleanrooms devoid of spacecraft hardware was far more diverse than that observed in cleanrooms that housed mission-critical spacecraft hardware. The latter was dominated by hardy, robust organisms previously reported to survive in oligotrophic cleanroom environments. Presented here are the findings of the first ever comprehensive effort to assess the viability of cells in low-biomass environmental samples, and correlate differential viability with phylogenetic affiliation.

Microbial existence in controlled habitats and their resistance to space conditions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10370681/,"Mouse models are critical tools in tuberculosis (TB) research. Recent studies have demonstrated that the wild mouse gut microbiota promotes host fitness and improves disease resistance. Here we examine whether the wild mouse gut microbiota alters the immunopathology of TB in BALB/c mice. Conventional BALB/c mice (LabC) and mice born to germ-free BALB/c mothers reconstituted with the wild mouse gut microbiota (WildR) were used in our studies. WildR mice controlled initial TB infection better than LabC mice. The microbial gut communities of LabC mice and WildR mice had similar richness but significantly different composition prior to infection. TB reduced the gut community richness in both cohorts while differences in community composition remained indicating a general TB-induced dysbiosis. The wild mouse gut microbiota did not alter the typical lung histopathology of TB in the BALB/c model that includes unstructured immune cell infiltrates with infected foamy macrophages invading alveolar spaces. Animals of both cohorts mounted robust T cell responses in lungs and spleen with lower absolute counts of CD4 and CD8 T cells in lungs of WildR mice during acute infection, corresponding with observed differences in pathogen load. In summary, LabC mice and WildR mice showed largely overlapping TB immunopathology and pathogen kinetics, with WildR mice controlling early acute infection better than LabC mice.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1b51/10370681/4d3943df252d/pone.0288290.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1b51/10370681/29260f7ea94b/pone.0288290.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1b51/10370681/267527524dda/pone.0288290.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1b51/10370681/5b645caf77cf/pone.0288290.g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/1b51/10370681/007a77074100/pone.0288290.g005.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

Characterization of Aspergillus fumigatus isolates from air and surfaces of the International Space Station.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9116463/,"The on-going Microbial Observatory Experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) revealed the presence of various microorganisms that may be affected by the distinct environment of the ISS. The low-nutrient environment combined with enhanced irradiation and microgravity may trigger changes in the molecular suite of microorganisms leading to increased virulence and resistance of microbes. Proteomic characterization of two Aspergillus fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, isolated from HEPA filter debris and cupola surface of the ISS, respectively, is presented, along with a comparison to experimentally established clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. In-depth analysis highlights variations in the proteome of both ISS-isolated strains when compared to the clinical strains. Proteins that showed increased abundance in ISS isolates were overall involved in stress responses, and carbohydrate and secondary metabolism. Among the most abundant proteins were Pst2 and ArtA involved in oxidative stress response, PdcA and AcuE responsible for ethanol fermentation and glyoxylate cycle, respectively, TpcA, TpcF, and TpcK that are part of trypacidin biosynthetic pathway, and a toxin Asp-hemolysin. This report provides insight into possible molecular adaptation of filamentous fungi to the unique ISS environment.

Microbial Characteristics of ISS Environmental Surfaces,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8421509/,"While sequencing technologies have revolutionized our knowledge of microbial diversity, little is known about the dynamic emergent phenotypes that arise within the context of mixed-species populations, which are not fully predicted using sequencing technologies alone. The International Space Station (ISS) is an isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross-sectional and longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using NASA-archived microbial isolates collected from the ISS potable water system over several years, we profiled five phenotypes: antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and biofilm structure/composition of individual or multispecies communities, which represent characteristics that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems. Data revealed a temporal dependence on interactive behaviors, suggesting possible microbial adaptation over time within the ecosystem. This study represents one of the most extensive phenotypic characterization of ISS potable water microbiota with implications for microbial risk assessments of water systems in built environments in space and on Earth.

Characterization of Aspergillus niger Isolated from the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7326050/,"Secondary metabolite (SM) production in Aspergillus niger JSC-093350089, isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), is reported, along with a comparison to the experimentally established strain ATCC 1015. The analysis revealed enhanced production levels of naphtho-γ-pyrones and therapeutically relevant SMs, including bicoumanigrin A, aurasperones A and B, and the antioxidant pyranonigrin A. Genetic variants that may be responsible for increased SM production levels in JSC-093350089 were identified. These findings include INDELs within the predicted promoter region of flbA , which encodes a developmental regulator that modulates pyranonigrin A production via regulation of Fum21. The pyranonigrin A biosynthetic gene cluster was confirmed in A. niger , which revealed the involvement of a previously undescribed gene, pyrE , in its biosynthesis. UVC sensitivity assays enabled characterization of pyranonigrin A as a UV resistance agent in the ISS isolate.

"International Space Station conditions alter genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics in Aspergillus nidulans.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9098231/,"The first global genomic, proteomic, and secondary metabolomic characterization of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans following growth onboard the International Space Station (ISS) is reported. The investigation included the A. nidulans wild-type and 3 mutant strains, two of which were genetically engineered to enhance secondary metabolite production. Whole genome sequencing revealed that ISS conditions altered the A. nidulans genome in specific regions. In strain CW12001, which features overexpression of the secondary metabolite global regulator laeA , ISS conditions induced the loss of the laeA stop codon. Differential expression of proteins involved in stress response, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis was also observed. ISS conditions significantly decreased prenyl xanthone production in the wild-type strain and increased asperthecin production in LO1362 and CW12001, which are deficient in a major DNA repair mechanism. These data provide valuable insights into the adaptation mechanism of A. nidulans to spacecraft environments.

Proteomic characterization of Aspergillus fumigatus isolated from air and surfaces of the International Space Station.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9116463/,"The on-going Microbial Observatory Experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) revealed the presence of various microorganisms that may be affected by the distinct environment of the ISS. The low-nutrient environment combined with enhanced irradiation and microgravity may trigger changes in the molecular suite of microorganisms leading to increased virulence and resistance of microbes. Proteomic characterization of two Aspergillus fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, isolated from HEPA filter debris and cupola surface of the ISS, respectively, is presented, along with a comparison to experimentally established clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. In-depth analysis highlights variations in the proteome of both ISS-isolated strains when compared to the clinical strains. Proteins that showed increased abundance in ISS isolates were overall involved in stress responses, and carbohydrate and secondary metabolism. Among the most abundant proteins were Pst2 and ArtA involved in oxidative stress response, PdcA and AcuE responsible for ethanol fermentation and glyoxylate cycle, respectively, TpcA, TpcF, and TpcK that are part of trypacidin biosynthetic pathway, and a toxin Asp-hemolysin. This report provides insight into possible molecular adaptation of filamentous fungi to the unique ISS environment.

Proteomic and Metabolomic Characteristics of Extremophilic Fungi Under Simulated Mars Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6529585/,"Filamentous fungi have been associated with extreme habitats, including nuclear power plant accident sites and the International Space Station (ISS). Due to their immense adaptation and phenotypic plasticity capacities, fungi may thrive in what seems like uninhabitable niches. This study is the first report of fungal survival after exposure of monolayers of conidia to simulated Mars conditions (SMC). Conidia of several Chernobyl nuclear accident-associated and ISS-isolated strains were tested for UV-C and SMC sensitivity, which resulted in strain-dependent survival. Strains surviving exposure to SMC for 30 min, ISSFT-021-30 and IMV 00236-30, were further characterized for proteomic, and metabolomic changes. Differential expression of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, translation, and carbohydrate metabolic processes was observed. No significant metabolome alterations were revealed. Lastly, ISSFT-021-30 conidia re-exposed to UV-C exhibited enhanced UV-C resistance when compared to the conidia of unexposed ISSFT-021.

"Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov., isolated from the International Space Station",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8005752/,"Four strains belonging to the family of Methylobacteriaceae were isolated from different locations on the International Space Station (ISS) across two consecutive flights. Of these, three were identified as Gram-negative, rod-shaped, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, motile bacteria, designated as IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, whereas the fourth was identified as Methylorubrum rhodesianum . The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains, designated as IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, was <99.4% for 16S rRNA genes and <97.3% for gyrB gene, with the closest being Methylobacterium indicum SE2.11 T . Furthermore, the multi-locus sequence analysis placed these three ISS strains in the same clade of M. indicum. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of these three ISS strains were <93% and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values were <46.4% with any described Methylobacterium species. Based on the ANI and dDDH analyses, these three ISS strains were considered as novel species belonging to the genus Methylobacterium. The three ISS strains showed 100% ANI similarity and dDDH values with each other, indicating that these three ISS strains, isolated during various flights and from different locations, belong to the same species. These three ISS strains were found to grow optimally at temperatures from 25 to 30°C, pH 6.0 to 8.0, and NaCl 0 to 1%. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains resemble M. aquaticum and M. terrae since they assimilate similar sugars as sole carbon substrate when compared to other Methylobacterium species. Fatty acid analysis showed that the major fatty acid produced by the ISS strains are C 18 : 1 −ω7 c and C 18 : 1 −ω6 c . The predominant quinone was ubiquinone 10, and the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and an unidentified lipid. Therefore, based on genomic, phylogenetic, biochemical, and fatty acid analyses, strains IF7SW-B2 T , IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, are assigned to a novel species within the genus Methylobacterium , and the name Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IF7SW-B2 T (NRRL B-65601 T and LMG 32165 T ).

Effects of simulated microgravity on the proteome and secretome of the polyextremotolerant black fungus Knufia chersonesos.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8012687/,"Black fungi are a group of melanotic microfungi characterized by remarkable polyextremotolerance. Due to a broad ecological plasticity and adaptations at the cellular level, it is predicted that they may survive in a variety of extreme environments, including harsh niches on Earth and Mars, and in outer space. However, the molecular mechanisms aiding survival, especially in space, are yet to be fully elucidated. Based on these premises, the rock-inhabiting black fungus Knufia chersonesos (Wt) and its non-melanized mutant (Mut) were exposed to simulated microgravity—one of the prevalent features characterizing space conditions—by growing the cultures in high-aspect-ratio vessels (HARVs). Qualitative and quantitative proteomic analyses were performed on the mycelia and supernatant of culture medium (secretome) to assess alterations in cell physiology in response to low-shear simulated microgravity (LSSMG) and to ultimately evaluate the role of cell-wall melanization in stress survival. Differential expression was observed for proteins involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolic processes, transport, and ribosome biogenesis and translation via ribosomal translational machinery. However, no evidence of significant activation of stress components or starvation response was detected, except for the scytalone dehydratase, enzyme involved in the synthesis of dihydroxynaphthalene (DNH) melanin, which was found to be upregulated in the secretome of the wild type and downregulated in the mutant. Differences in protein modulation were observed between K. chersonesos Wt and Mut, with several proteins being downregulated under LSSMG in the Mut when compared to the Wt. Lastly, no major morphological alterations were observed following exposure to LSSMG. Similarly, the strains’ survivability was not negatively affected. This study is the first to characterize the response to simulated microgravity in black fungi, which might have implications on future astrobiological missions.

Evaluating the lettuce metatranscriptome with MinION sequencing for future spaceflight food production applications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8211661/,"Healthy plants are vital for successful, long-duration missions in space, as they provide the crew with life support, food production, and psychological benefits. The microorganisms that associate with plant tissues play a critical role in improving plant health and production. To that end, we developed a methodology to investigate the transcriptional activities of the microbiome of red romaine lettuce, a key salad crop that was grown under International Space Station (ISS)-like conditions. Microbial transcripts enriched from host–microbe total RNA were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform. Results show that this enrichment approach was highly reproducible and could be an effective approach for the on-site detection of microbial transcriptional activity. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using metatranscriptomics of enriched microbial RNA as a potential method for on-site monitoring of the transcriptional activity of crop microbiomes, thereby helping to facilitate and maintain plant health for on-orbit space food production.

Investigation of Spaceflight Induced Changes to Astronaut Microbiomes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11988970/,"Space flight has many adverse effects on the physiological functions of astronauts. Certain similarities have been observed in some physiological processes of rodents and astronauts in space, although there are also differences. These similarities make rodents helpful models for initial investigations into space-induced physiological changes. This study uses a 3D-Clinostat to simulate microgravity and explores the role of microgravity in space flight-induced liver and brain abnormalities by comparing changes in the gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and the function and physiological biochemistry of liver and brain tissues between the simulated microgravity (SMG) group mice and the wild type (WT) group mice. The study, based on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, 16S sequencing technology, and non-targeted metabolomics analysis, shows that the gut tissue morphology of the SMG group mice is abnormal, and the structure of the gut microbiota and the serum metabolite profile are imbalanced. Furthermore, using PICRUST 2 technology, we have predicted the functions of the gut microbiota and serum metabolites, and the results indicate that the liver metabolism and functions (including lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and sugar metabolism, etc.) of the SMG group mice are disrupted, and the brain tissue metabolism and functions (including neurotransmitters and hormone secretion, etc.) are abnormal, suggesting a close relationship between microgravity and liver metabolic dysfunction and brain dysfunction. Additionally, the high similarity in the structure of the gut microbiota and serum metabolite profile between the fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) group mice and the SMG group mice, and the physiological and biochemical differences in liver and brain tissues compared to the WT group mice, suggest that microgravity induces imbalances in the gut microbiota, which in turn triggers abnormalities in liver and brain metabolism and function. Finally, through MetaMapp analysis and Pearson correlation analysis, we found that valeric acid, a metabolite of gut microbiota, is more likely to be the key metabolite that relates to microgravity-induced gut microbiota abnormalities, disorders of amino acid and lipid metabolism, and further induced metabolic or functional disorders in the liver and brain. This study has significant practical application value for deepening the understanding of the adaptability of living organisms in the space environment.

"Genomic Characterization of the Titan-like Cell Producing Naganishia tulchinskyi, the First Novel Eukaryote Isolated from the International Space Station",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8875396/,"Multiple strains of a novel yeast belonging to genus Naganishia were isolated from environmental surfaces aboard the International Space Station (ISS). These strains exhibited a phenotype similar to Titan cell (~10 µm diameter) morphology when grown under a combination of simulated microgravity and 5% CO 2 conditions. Confocal, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy revealed distinct morphological differences between the microgravity-grown cells and the standard Earth gravity-grown cells, including larger cells and thicker cell walls, altered intracellular morphology, modifications to extracellular fimbriae, budding, and the shedding of bud scars. Phylogenetic analyses via multi-locus sequence typing indicated that these ISS strains represented a single species in the genus Naganishia and were clustered with Naganishia diffluens . The name Naganishia tulchinskyi is proposed to accommodate these strains, with IF6SW-B1 T as the holotype. The gene ontologies were assigned to the cell morphogenesis, microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, suggesting a variety of phenotypes that are well suited to respond to microgravity and radiation. Genomic analyses also indicated that the extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were among the highest cellular component results, thus implying a set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity. Finally, the highest molecular function matches included cytoskeletal motor activity, microtubule motor activity, and nuclear export signal receptor activity.

"Microbial Burden Estimation of Food Items, Built Environments, and the International Space Station Using Film Media",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9503880/,"The use of film media involves considerably less preparation, waste, and incubator space than conventional agar-media-based assays and has proven in past studies to provide counts of cultivable microbes similar to those of traditional agar media. Film media also have the advantage of allowing sample volumes similar to those used in pour plates and, therefore, are well-suited for cultivable microbial counts in extremely low-biomass environments such as clean rooms or space habitats, particularly where the subsequent isolation of colonies is necessary. As the preparation of film media plates relies on water cohesion/adhesion rather than manual spreading, they may have future applications in low- or microgravity settings. In this study, cultivable microbial count performance was compared between agar media and film media in three kinds of samples: food items, surfaces in built environments on Earth (homes), and on the environmental surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS). Easy Plates (Kikkoman Corporation) and Petrifilm (3M) were compared with traditional agar plating for food and home surfaces, while only Easy Plates were compared with agar for ISS samples. For both food items and built environments on Earth, both types of film media performed comparably to agar media for bacterial counts, with R 2 values of 0.94–0.96. Fungal counts for built-environment samples had a lower correlation between film and agar counts, with R 2 values of 0.72–0.73. Samples from the ISS, which ranged from below detection to 10 3 CFU per 100 cm 2 , had R 2 values of 0.80 for bacterial counts and 0.73 for fungal counts, partially due to multiple samples recording below the detection limit for agar or too numerous to count, and the growth of fungal species on R2A medium. The species compositions of isolates picked from agar vs. film media plates were similar; however, further phylogenetic analysis is needed to confirm the differential microbial diversity composition. Overall, film media such as Easy Plates and Petrifilm are viable alternatives to agar plates for low-biomass built environments as well as for food samples, and the two brands tested in this study performed equally well.

Comparative genomic analysis of Cohnella hashimotonis sp. nov. isolated from the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10308117/,"A single strain from the family Paenibacillaceae was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2018, as part of the Microbial Tracking mission series. This strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus Cohnella , designated as F6_2S_P_1 T . The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1 T strain places it in a clade with C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli , which were originally isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere environments. The closest 16S and gyrB matches to strain F6_2S_P_1 T are to C. rhizosphaerae with 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available Cohnella genomes places it as more closely related to C. ginsengisoli . Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to any described Cohnella species are <89 and <22%, respectively. The major fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1 T are anteiso-C 15:0 (51.7%), iso-C 16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C 15:0 (10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis , with the type strain F6_2S_P_1 T (=NRRL B-65657 T and DSMZ 115098 T ). Because no closely related Cohnella genomes were available, this study generated the whole-genome sequences (WGSs) of the type strains for C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli . Phylogenetic and pangenomic analysis reveals that F6_2S_P_1 T , C. rhizosphaerae , and C. ginsengisoli , along with two uncharacterized Cohnella strains, possess a shared set of 332 gene clusters which are not shared with any other WGS of Cohnella species, and form a distinct clade branching off from C. nanjingensis . Functional traits were predicted for the genomes of strain F6_2S_P_1 T and other members of this clade.

"Phylogenomics, phenotypic, and functional traits of five novel (Earth-derived) bacterial species isolated from the International Space Station and their prevalence in metagenomes",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10628120/,"With the advent of long-term human habitation in space and on the moon, understanding how the built environment microbiome of space habitats differs from Earth habitats, and how microbes survive, proliferate and spread in space conditions, is becoming more important. The microbial tracking mission series has been monitoring the microbiome of the International Space Station (ISS) for almost a decade. During this mission series, six unique strains of Gram-stain-positive bacteria, including two spore-forming and three non-spore-forming species, were isolated from the environmental surfaces of the ISS. The analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed > 99% similarities with previously described bacterial species. To further explore their phylogenetic affiliation, whole genome sequencing was undertaken. For all strains, the gyrB gene exhibited < 93% similarity with closely related species, which proved effective in categorizing these ISS strains as novel species. Average nucleotide identity and digital DNA–DNA hybridization values, when compared to any known bacterial species, were < 94% and <50% respectively for all species described here. Traditional biochemical tests, fatty acid profiling, polar lipid, and cell wall composition analyses were performed to generate phenotypic characterization of these ISS strains. A study of the shotgun metagenomic reads from the ISS samples, from which the novel species were isolated, showed that only 0.1% of the total reads mapped to the novel species, supporting the idea that these novel species are rare in the ISS environments. In-depth annotation of the genomes unveiled a variety of genes linked to amino acid and derivative synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments, and protein metabolism. Further analysis of these ISS-isolated organisms revealed that, on average, they contain 46 genes associated with virulence, disease, and defense. The main predicted functions of these genes are: conferring resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, and enabling invasion and intracellular resistance. After conducting antiSMASH analysis, it was found that there are roughly 16 cluster types across the six strains, including β-lactone and type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters. Based on these multi-faceted taxonomic methods, it was concluded that these six ISS strains represent five novel species, which we propose to name as follows: Arthrobacter burdickii IIF3SC-B10 T (= NRRL B-65660 T = DSM 115933 T ), Leifsonia virtsii F6_8S_P_1A T (= NRRL B-65661 T = DSM 115931 T ), Leifsonia williamsii F6_8S_P_1B T (= NRRL B-65662 T = DSM 115932 T ), Paenibacillus vandeheii F6_3S_P_1C T (= NRRL B-65663 T = DSM 115940 T ), and Sporosarcina highlanderae F6_3S_P_2 T (= NRRL B-65664 T = DSM 115943 T ). Identifying and characterizing the genomes and phenotypes of novel microbes found in space habitats, like those explored in this study, is integral for expanding our genomic databases of space-relevant microbes. This approach offers the only reliable method to determine species composition, track microbial dispersion, and anticipate potential threats to human health from monitoring microbes on the surfaces and equipment within space habitats. By unraveling these microbial mysteries, we take a crucial step towards ensuring the safety and success of future space missions.

In-depth annotation of the genomes unveiled a variety of genes linked to amino acid and derivative synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments, and protein metabolism. Further analysis of these ISS-isolated organisms revealed that, on average, they contain 46 genes associated with virulence, disease, and defense. The main predicted functions of these genes are: conferring resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, and enabling invasion and intracellular resistance. After conducting antiSMASH analysis, it was found that there are roughly 16 cluster types across the six strains, including β-lactone and type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters. Based on these multi-faceted taxonomic methods, it was concluded that these six ISS strains represent five novel species, which we propose to name as follows: Arthrobacter burdickii IIF3SC-B10 T (= NRRL B-65660 T = DSM 115933 T ), Leifsonia virtsii F6_8S_P_1A T (= NRRL B-65661 T = DSM 115931 T ), Leifsonia williamsii F6_8S_P_1B T (= NRRL B-65662 T = DSM 115932 T ), Paenibacillus vandeheii F6_3S_P_1C T (= NRRL B-65663 T = DSM 115940 T ), and Sporosarcina highlanderae F6_3S_P_2 T (= NRRL B-65664 T = DSM 115943 T ). Identifying and characterizing the genomes and phenotypes of novel microbes found in space habitats, like those explored in this study, is integral for expanding our genomic databases of space-relevant microbes. This approach offers the only reliable method to determine species composition, track microbial dispersion, and anticipate potential threats to human health from monitoring microbes on the surfaces and equipment within space habitats. By unraveling these microbial mysteries, we take a crucial step towards ensuring the safety and success of future space missions.

Spatial regulation of a common precursor from two distinct genes generates metabolite diversity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5523082/,"In secondary metabolite biosynthesis, core synthetic genes such as polyketide synthase genes usually encode proteins that generate various backbone precursors. These precursors are modified by other tailoring enzymes to yield a large variety of different secondary metabolites. The number of core synthesis genes in a given species correlates, therefore, with the number of types of secondary metabolites the organism can produce. In our study, heterologous expression of all the A. terreus NRPS-like genes showed that two NRPS-like proteins, encoded by atmelA and apvA , release the same natural product, aspulvinone E. In hyphae this compound is converted to aspulvinones whereas in conidia it is converted to melanin. The genes are expressed in different tissues and this spatial control is probably regulated by their own specific promoters. Comparative genomics indicates that atmelA and apvA might share a same ancestral gene and the gene apvA is located in a highly conserved region in Aspergillus species that contains genes coding for life-essential proteins. Our data reveal the first case in secondary metabolite biosynthesis in which the tissue specific production of a single compound directs it into two separate pathways, producing distinct compounds with different functions. Our data also reveal that a single trans -prenyltransferase, AbpB, prenylates two substrates, aspulvinones and butyrolactones, revealing that genes outside of contiguous secondary metabolism gene clusters can modify more than one compound thereby expanding metabolite diversity. Our study raises the possibility of incorporation of spatial, cell-type specificity in expression of secondary metabolites of biological interest and provides new insight into designing and reconstituting their biosynthetic pathways.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-chemsci.gif"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f768/5523082/90941d11d5a5/c5sc01058f-ga.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f768/5523082/6a4256175c8a/c5sc01058f-f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f768/5523082/ec1a7f0ee243/c5sc01058f-f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f768/5523082/62ecebaad9dc/c5sc01058f-f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f768/5523082/edbb909a4dea/c5sc01058f-f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/f768/5523082/868904641894/c5sc01058f-f5.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Recent advances in the genome mining of Aspergillus secondary metabolites (covering 2012‚Äì2018).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6590338/,"Secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by filamentous fungi possess diverse bioactivities that make them excellent drug candidates. Whole genome sequencing has revealed that fungi have the capacity to produce a far greater number of SMs than have been isolated, since many of the genes involved in SM biosynthesis are either silent or expressed at very low levels in standard laboratory conditions. There has been significant effort to activate SM biosynthetic genes and link them to their downstream products, as the SMs produced by these “cryptic” pathways offer a promising source for new drug discovery. Further, an understanding of the genes involved in SM biosynthesis facilitates product yield optimization of first-generation molecules and genetic engineering of second-generation analogs. This review covers advances made in genome mining SMs produced by Aspergillus nidulans , Aspergillus fumigatus , Aspergillus niger , and Aspergillus terreus in the past six years (2012–2018). Genetic identification and molecular characterization of SM biosynthetic gene clusters, along with proposed biosynthetic pathways, will be discussed in depth.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-medchemcomm.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/201638dc36c3/c9md00054b-ga.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/1f809baa6788/c9md00054b-s1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/7ed6ac786035/c9md00054b-s2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/76e3043246ac/c9md00054b-s3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/9ef0eb76c111/c9md00054b-s4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/fe6a97bf5c57/c9md00054b-s5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/f6b0feba2a62/c9md00054b-s6.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/84c374fc7284/c9md00054b-s7.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/608ae8f1f20e/c9md00054b-s8.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/b5cc77ad7492/c9md00054b-s9.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/0aa722d7cb96/c9md00054b-s10.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/254da8dc27d3/c9md00054b-s11.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/5b89ad3556f4/c9md00054b-s12.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/7ab1e255a359/c9md00054b-s13.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/472b1aa56194/c9md00054b-s14.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/1244387912be/c9md00054b-s15.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/63a14dbcc5f7/c9md00054b-s16.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/08bc9e3176d9/c9md00054b-s17.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/78ba1a23d547/c9md00054b-s18.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/d1d02bf213d0/c9md00054b-s19.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/a3bb9440ce2b/c9md00054b-s20.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/39f19b9aefae/c9md00054b-s21.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/1c0aaa455d78/c9md00054b-s22.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/767d80d8b5b5/c9md00054b-s23.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/91e42b3da05b/c9md00054b-s24.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/04df055c6a1c/c9md00054b-s25.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/1c02e364dfa4/c9md00054b-s26.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/657fc8743ce4/c9md00054b-s27.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/15494aaf4c6c/c9md00054b-p1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/c16d/6590338/567e32ac8959/c9md00054b-p2.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Cortical thinning and structural bone changes in non-human primates after single-fraction whole-chest irradiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6036641/,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is associated with an increased risk of vertebral compression fracture ( 1 – 5 ). While bone is typically considered radiation-resistant, fractures frequently occur within the first year of SBRT ( 6 – 11 ). Our purpose was to determine if rapid deterioration of bone occurs in vertebrae post-irradiation (IR). Sixteen male rhesus macaques non-human primates (NHPs) were analyzed after total chest irradiation (IR) to a midplane dose of 10 Gy. Ages at IR varied from 45 – 134 mo. Computed tomography (CT) scans were taken 2 mo prior to IR and 2, 4, 6, and 8 mo post-IR for all animals. Bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) were calculated longitudinally for thoracic (T)9, lumbar (L)2, and L4 vertebral bodies; gross morphology and histopathology were assessed per vertebra. Greater mortality (related to pulmonary toxicity) was noted in NHPs < 50 mo at time of IR vs NHPs > 50mo (p = 0.03). Animals older than 50 mo at IR lost Ct.Th in T9 by 2 mo post IR (p = 0.0009), which persisted to 8 mo. In contrast, no loss of Ct.Th was observed in vertebrae out-of-field (L2 and L4). Loss of BMD was observed by 4 mo post-IR for T9, and 6 mo post IR for L2 and L4 (p < 0.01). For NHPs younger than 50 mo at IR, both Ct.Th and BMD decreased in T9, L2, and L4 by 2 mo post-IR (p < 0.05). Regions that exhibited the greatest degree of cortical thinning as determined from CT scans also exhibited increased porosity histologically. Rapid loss of Ct.Th was observed after high dose chest IR in NHPs. Younger age at IR was associated with increased pneumonitis related mortality, as well as greater loss of both BMD and Ct.Th at both in-and out-of-field vertebrae. Older NHPs exhibited rapid loss of BMD and Ct.Th from in-field vertebrae, but only loss of BMD in out of field vertebrae. Bone is sensitive to high dose radiation, and rapid loss of bone structure and density could facilitate fractures.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-nihpa.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0470/6036641/7ab898b6ea2c/nihms978191f1.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0470/6036641/9e50451c7e76/nihms978191f2.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0470/6036641/56dde5944de7/nihms978191f3.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0470/6036641/2a8d302b0b27/nihms978191f4.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0470/6036641/03992886f06e/nihms978191f5.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0470/6036641/b54f8f16fe71/nihms978191f6.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0470/6036641/dfc6a0f2f383/nihms978191f7.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Knee and Hip Joint Cartilage Damage from Combined Spaceflight Hazards of Low-Dose Radiation Less than 1 Gy and Prolonged Hindlimb Unloading.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6599637/,"Kwok, A. T., Moore, J. E., Rosas, S., Kerr, B. A., Andrews, R. N., Nguyen, C. M., Lee, J., Furdui, C. M., Collins, B. E., Munley, M. T. and Willey, J. S. Knee and Hip Joint Cartilage Damage from Combined Spaceflight Hazards of Low-Dose Radiation Less than 1 Gy and Prolonged Hinlimb Unloading. Radiat. Res. 191, 497–506 (2019).
Reduced weight bearing, and to a lesser extent radiation, during spaceflight have been shown as potential hazards to astronaut joint health. These hazards combined effect to the knee and hip joints are not well defined, particularly with low-dose exposure to radiation. In this study, we examined the individual and combined effects of varying low-dose radiation (≤1 Gy) and reduced weight bearing on the cartilage of the knee and hip joints. C57BL/6J mice (n = 80) were either tail suspended via hindlimb unloading (HLU) or remained full-weight bearing (ground). On day 6, each group was divided and irradiated with 0 Gy (sham), 0.1 Gy, 0.5 Gy or 1.0 Gy (n = 10/group), yielding eight groups: ground-sham; ground-0.1 Gy; ground-0.5 Gy; ground-1.0 Gy; HLU-sham; HLU-0.1 Gy; HLU-0.5 Gy; and HLU-1.0 Gy. On day 30, the hindlimbs, hip cartilage and serum were collected from the mice. Significant differences were identified statistically between treatment groups and the ground-sham control group, but no significant differences were observed between HLU and/or radiation groups. Contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography (micro-CECT) demonstrated decrease in volume and thickness at the weight-bearing femoral-tibial cartilage-cartilage contact point in all treatment groups compared to ground-sham. Lower collagen was observed in all groups compared to ground-sham. Circulating serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP), a biomarker for ongoing cartilage degradation, was increased in all of the irradiated groups compared to ground-sham, regardless of unloading. Mass spectrometry of the cartilage lining the femoral head and subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified a decrease in cartilage compositional proteins indicative of osteoarthritis. Our findings demonstrate that both individually and combined, HLU and exposure to spaceflight-relevant radiation doses lead to cartilage degradation of the knee and hip with expression of an arthritic phenotype. Moreover, early administration of low-dose irradiation (0.1, 0.5 or 1.0 Gy) causes an active catabolic response in cartilage 24 days postirradiation. Further research is warranted with a focus on the prevention of cartilage degradation from long-term periods of reduced weight bearing and spaceflight-relevant low doses and qualities of radiation.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-nihpa.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0ac0/6599637/ff31100d4f74/nihms-1034502-f0001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0ac0/6599637/4171694977ec/nihms-1034502-f0002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0ac0/6599637/ef795ee00993/nihms-1034502-f0003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0ac0/6599637/6fab54076704/nihms-1034502-f0004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0ac0/6599637/e14cf5bd14ae/nihms-1034502-f0005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/0ac0/6599637/c21eb8cab3e5/nihms-1034502-f0006.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
The individual and combined effects of spaceflight radiation and microgravity on biologic systems and functional outcomes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8274610/,"Both microgravity and radiation exposure in the spaceflight environment have been identified as hazards to astronaut health and performance. Substantial study has been focused on understanding the biology and risks associated with prolonged exposure to microgravity, and the hazards presented by radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPEs) outside of low earth orbit (LEO). To date, the majority of the ground-based analogues (e.g., rodent or cell culture studies) that investigate the biology of and risks associated with spaceflight hazards will focus on an individual hazard in isolation. However, astronauts will face these challenges simultaneously Combined hazard studies are necessary for understanding the risks astronauts face as they travel outside of LEO, and are also critical for countermeasure development. The focus of this review is to describe biologic and functional outcomes from ground-based analogue models for microgravity and radiation, specifically highlighting the combined effects of radiation and reduced weight-bearing from rodent ground-based tail suspension via hind limb unloading (HLU) and partial weight-bearing (PWB) models, although in vitro and spaceflight results are discussed as appropriate. The review focuses on the skeletal, ocular, central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular, and stem cells responses.

Spaceflight and hind limb unloading induces an arthritic phenotype in knee articular cartilage and menisci of rodents,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8131644/,"Reduced knee weight-bearing from prescription or sedentary lifestyles are associated with cartilage degradation; effects on the meniscus are unclear. Rodents exposed to spaceflight or hind limb unloading (HLU) represent unique opportunities to evaluate this question. This study evaluated arthritic changes in the medial knee compartment that bears the highest loads across the knee after actual and simulated spaceflight, and recovery with subsequent full weight-bearing. Cartilage and meniscal degradation in mice were measured via microCT, histology, and proteomics and/or biochemically after: (1) ~ 35 days on the International Space Station (ISS); (2) 13-days aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis; or (3) 30 days of HLU, followed by a 49-day weight-bearing readaptation with/without exercise. Cartilage degradation post-ISS and HLU occurred at similar spatial locations, the tibial-femoral cartilage-cartilage contact point, with meniscal volume decline. Cartilage and meniscal glycosaminoglycan content were decreased in unloaded mice, with elevated catabolic enzymes (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases), and elevated oxidative stress and catabolic molecular pathway responses in menisci. After the 13-day Shuttle flight, meniscal degradation was observed. During readaptation, recovery of cartilage volume and thickness occurred with exercise. Reduced weight-bearing from either spaceflight or HLU induced an arthritic phenotype in cartilage and menisci, and exercise promoted recovery.

Prolonged exposure to particulate chromate inhibits RAD51 nuclear import mediator proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5568470/,"Particulate hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is a human lung carcinogen and a human health concern. The induction of structural chromosome instability is considered to be a driving mechanism of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis. Homologous recombination repair protects against Cr(VI)-induced chromosome damage, due to its highly accurate repair of Cr(VI)-induced DNA double strand breaks. However, recent studies demonstrate Cr(VI) inhibits homologous recombination repair through the misregulation of RAD51. RAD51 is an essential protein in HR repair that facilitates the search for a homologous sequence. Recent studies show prolonged Cr(VI) exposure prevents proper RAD51 subcellular localization, causing it to accumulate in the cytoplasm. Since nuclear import of RAD51 is crucial to its function, this study investigated the effect of Cr(VI) on the RAD51 nuclear import mediators, RAD51C and BRCA2. We show acute (24 h) Cr(VI) exposure induces the proper localization of RAD51C and BRCA2. In contrast, prolonged (120 h) exposure increased the cytoplasmic localization of both proteins, although RAD51C localization was more severely impaired. These results correlate temporally with the previously reported Cr(VI)-induced RAD51 cytoplasmic accumulation. In addition, we found Cr(VI) does not inhibit interaction between RAD51 and its nuclear import mediators. Altogether, our results suggest prolonged Cr(VI) exposure inhibits the nuclear import of RAD51C, and to a lesser extent, BRCA2, which results in the cytoplasmic accumulation of RAD51. Cr(VI)-induced inhibition of nuclear import may play a key role in its carcinogenic mechanism since the nuclear import of many tumor suppressor proteins and DNA repair proteins is crucial to their function.

"Transcriptomics, NF-Œ∫B Pathway, and Their Potential Spaceflight-Related Health Consequences.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5485990/,"In space, living organisms are exposed to multiple stress factors including microgravity and space radiation. For humans, these harmful environmental factors have been known to cause negative health impacts such as bone loss and immune dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms by which spaceflight impacts human health at the molecular level is critical not only for accurately assessing the risks associated with spaceflight, but also for developing effective countermeasures. Over the years, a number of studies have been conducted under real or simulated space conditions. RNA and protein levels in cellular and animal models have been targeted in order to identify pathways affected by spaceflight. Of the many pathways responsive to the space environment, the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) network appears to commonly be affected across many different cell types under the true or simulated spaceflight conditions. NF-κB is of particular interest, as it is associated with many of the spaceflight-related health consequences. This review intends to summarize the transcriptomics studies that identified NF-κB as a responsive pathway to ground-based simulated microgravity or the true spaceflight condition. These studies were carried out using either human cell or animal models. In addition, the review summarizes the studies that focused specifically on NF-κB pathway in specific cell types or organ tissues as related to the known spaceflight-related health risks including immune dysfunction, bone loss, muscle atrophy, central nerve system (CNS) dysfunction, and risks associated with space radiation. Whether the NF-κB pathway is activated or inhibited in space is dependent on the cell type, but the potential health impact appeared to be always negative. It is argued that more studies on NF-κB should be conducted to fully understand this particular pathway for the benefit of crew health in space.

Interplay of space radiation and microgravity in DNA damage and DNA damage response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5460239/,"In space, multiple unique environmental factors, particularly microgravity and space radiation, pose constant threat to the DNA integrity of living organisms. Specifically, space radiation can cause damage to DNA directly, through the interaction of charged particles with the DNA molecules themselves, or indirectly through the production of free radicals. Although organisms have evolved strategies on Earth to confront such damage, space environmental conditions, especially microgravity, can impact DNA repair resulting in accumulation of severe DNA lesions. Ultimately these lesions, namely double strand breaks, chromosome aberrations, micronucleus formation, or mutations, can increase the risk for adverse health effects, such as cancer. How spaceflight factors affect DNA damage and the DNA damage response has been investigated since the early days of the human space program. Over the years, these experiments have been conducted either in space or using ground-based analogs. This review summarizes the evidence for DNA damage induction by space radiation and/or microgravity as well as spaceflight-related impacts on the DNA damage response. The review also discusses the conflicting results from studies aimed at addressing the question of potential synergies between microgravity and radiation with regard to DNA damage and cellular repair processes. We conclude that further experiments need to be performed in the true space environment in order to address this critical question.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-npjmicrogr.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
"Synergistic Effects of Weightlessness, Isoproterenol, and Radiation on DNA Damage Response and Cytokine Production in Immune Cells",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6275019/,"The implementation of rotating-wall vessels (RWVs) for studying the effect of lack of gravity has attracted attention, especially in the fields of stem cells, tissue regeneration, and cancer research. Immune cells incubated in RWVs exhibit several features of immunosuppression including impaired leukocyte proliferation, cytokine responses, and antibody production. Interestingly, stress hormones influence cellular immune pathways affected by microgravity, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and T cell activation. These pathways are crucial defense mechanisms that protect the cell from toxins, pathogens, and radiation. Despite the importance of the adrenergic receptor in regulating the immune system, the effect of microgravity on the adrenergic system has been poorly studied. Thus, we elected to investigate the synergistic effects of isoproterenol (a sympathomimetic drug), radiation, and microgravity in nonstimulated immune cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with the sympathomimetic drug isoproterenol, exposed to 0.8 or 2 Gy γ-radiation, and incubated in RWVs. Mixed model regression analyses showed significant synergistic effects on the expression of the β2-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2). Radiation alone increased ADRB2 expression, and cells incubated in microgravity had more DNA strand breaks than cells incubated in normal gravity. We observed radiation-induced cytokine production only in microgravity. Prior treatment with isoproterenol clearly prevents most of the microgravity-mediated effects. RWVs may be a useful tool to provide insight into novel regulatory pathways, providing benefit not only to astronauts but also to patients suffering from immune disorders or undergoing radiotherapy.

Transcriptome and proteome responses in RNAlater preserved tissue of Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5397022/,"Tissue preservation is a minimal requirement for the success of plant RNA and protein expression studies. The standard of snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen is not always practical or possible. RNAlater, a concentrated solution of ammonium and cesium sulfates, has become a standard preservative in the absence of liquid nitrogen. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RNAlater in preserving both RNA and proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana tissues for use in RNAseq and LC-MS/MS analysis of proteins. While successful in preserving plant material, a transcriptomic and proteomic response is evident. Specifically, 5770 gene transcripts, 84 soluble proteins, and 120 membrane-bound proteins were found to be differentially expressed at a log-fold change of ±1 (P ≤ 0.05). This response is mirrored in the abundance of post-translational modifications, with 23 of the 108 (21.3%) phosphorylated proteins showing altered abundance at a log-fold change of ±1 (P ≤ 0.05). While RNAlater is effective in preserving biological information, our findings warrant caution in its use for transcriptomic and proteomic experiments.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/747a/5397022/81701547bb37/pone.0175943.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/747a/5397022/363db3dbe096/pone.0175943.g002.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]

Mitigation and use of biofilms in space for the benefit of human space exploration,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10284894/,"With the construction of the International Space Station, humans have been continuously living and working in space for 22 years. Microbial studies in space and other extreme environments on Earth have shown the ability for bacteria and fungi to adapt and change compared to “normal” conditions. Some of these changes, like biofilm formation, can impact astronaut health and spacecraft integrity in a negative way, while others, such as a propensity for plastic degradation, can promote self-sufficiency and sustainability in space. With the next era of space exploration upon us, which will see crewed missions to the Moon and Mars in the next 10 years, incorporating microbiology research into planning, decision-making, and mission design will be paramount to ensuring success of these long-duration missions. These can include astronaut microbiome studies to protect against infections, immune system dysfunction and bone deterioration, or biological in situ resource utilization (bISRU) studies that incorporate microbes to act as radiation shields, create electricity and establish robust plant habitats for fresh food and recycling of waste. In this review, information will be presented on the beneficial use of microbes in bioregenerative life support systems, their applicability to bISRU, and their capability to be genetically engineered for biotechnological space applications. In addition, we discuss the negative effect microbes and microbial communities may have on long-duration space travel and provide mitigation strategies to reduce their impact. Utilizing the benefits of microbes, while understanding their limitations, will help us explore deeper into space and develop sustainable human habitats on the Moon, Mars and beyond.

Longitudinal characterization of multispecies microbial populations recovered from spaceflight potable water,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8421509/,"While sequencing technologies have revolutionized our knowledge of microbial diversity, little is known about the dynamic emergent phenotypes that arise within the context of mixed-species populations, which are not fully predicted using sequencing technologies alone. The International Space Station (ISS) is an isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross-sectional and longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using NASA-archived microbial isolates collected from the ISS potable water system over several years, we profiled five phenotypes: antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and biofilm structure/composition of individual or multispecies communities, which represent characteristics that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems. Data revealed a temporal dependence on interactive behaviors, suggesting possible microbial adaptation over time within the ecosystem. This study represents one of the most extensive phenotypic characterization of ISS potable water microbiota with implications for microbial risk assessments of water systems in built environments in space and on Earth.

Designing a Novel Monitoring Approach for the Effects of Space Travel on Astronauts‚Äô Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9964234/,"Space exploration and extraterrestrial civilization have fascinated humankind since the earliest days of human history. It was only in the last century that humankind finally began taking significant steps towards these goals by sending astronauts into space, landing on the moon, and building the International Space Station. However, space voyage is very challenging and dangerous, and astronauts are under constant space radiation and microgravity. It has been shown that astronauts are at a high risk of developing a broad range of diseases/disorders. Thus, it is critical to develop a rapid and effective assay to monitor astronauts’ health in space. In this study, gene expression and correlation patterns were analyzed for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) using the publicly available microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708. We identified 218 differentially expressed genes between In-flight and Pre-flight and noticed that space travel decreased genome regulation and gene correlations across the entire genome, as well as individual signaling pathways. Furthermore, we systematically developed a shortlist of 32 genes that could be used to monitor astronauts’ health during space travel. Further studies, including microgravity experiments, are warranted to optimize and validate the proposed assay.

Burn injury-associated MHCII(+) immune cell accumulation around lymphatic vessels of the mesentery and increased lymphatic endothelial permeability are blocked by doxycycline treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5810432/,"It is theorized that toxic agents are transported from the hyperpermeable gut of burn victims through the lymph, to the systemic circulation, causing global injury. We believe that immune cells respond to leakage of “toxic lymph” following trauma causing the attraction of these cells to the perilymphatic space. To test this, we utilized a model of burn on rats to examine changes in a single immune cell population associated with mesenteric lymphatic dysfunction. We examined the ability of serum from these animals to increase permeability in lymphatic endothelial monolayers and disrupt cellular junctions. We also treated burn animals with doxycycline, an inhibitor of microvascular permeability, and observed the effects on immune cell populations, morphometry, and lymphatic endothelial permeability. Burn injury increased the number of MHCII + immune cells along the vessel (>50%). The size and shape of these cells also changed significantly following burn injury. Serum from burn animals increased lymphatic endothelial permeability (∼1.5-fold) and induced breaks in VE-cadherin staining. Doxycycline treatment blocked the accumulation of immune cells along the vessel, whereas serum from doxycycline-treated animals failed to increase lymphatic endothelial permeability. The size of cells along the vessel in doxycycline-treated burn animals was not affected, suggesting that the cells already present on the lymphatic vessels still respond to substances in the lymph. These findings suggest that factors produced during burn can induce lymphatic endothelial barrier disruption and lymph produced during traumatic injury can influence the attraction and morphology of immune cell populations along the vessel.

CubeSats for microbiology and astrobiology research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10261121/,"Space experiments are a technically challenging but a scientifically important part of astrobiology and astrochemistry research. The International Space Station (ISS) is an excellent example of a highly successful and long-lasting research platform for experiments in space, that has provided a wealth of scientific data over the last two decades. However, future space platforms present new opportunities to conduct experiments with the potential to address key topics in astrobiology and astrochemistry. In this perspective, the European Space Agency (ESA) Topical Team Astrobiology and Astrochemistry (with feedback from the wider scientific community) identifies a number of key topics and summarizes the 2021 “ESA SciSpacE Science Community White Paper” for astrobiology and astrochemistry. We highlight recommendations for the development and implementation of future experiments, discuss types of in situ measurements, experimental parameters, exposure scenarios and orbits, and identify knowledge gaps and how to advance scientific utilization of future space-exposure platforms that are either currently under development or in an advanced planning stage. In addition to the ISS, these platforms include CubeSats and SmallSats, as well as larger platforms such as the Lunar Orbital Gateway. We also provide an outlook for in situ experiments on the Moon and Mars, and welcome new possibilities to support the search for exoplanets and potential biosignatures within and beyond our solar system.

"Simulated micro-, lunar, and Martian gravities on Earth‚Äîeffects on Escherichia coli growth, phenotype, and sensitivity to antibiotics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9502502/,"Bacterial behavior has been studied under microgravity conditions, but very little is known about it under lunar and Martian gravitational regimes. An Earth-based approach was designed and implemented using inclined clinostats and an in-house-developed code to determine the optimal clinorotation angular speed for bacterial liquid cultures of 5 RPM. With this setup, growth dynamics, phenotypic changes, and sensitivity to antibiotics (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of two different classes of antibiotics) for three Escherichia coli strains (including uropathogenic) were examined under simulated micro-, lunar, and Martian gravities. The results included increased growth under simulated micro- and lunar gravities for some strains, and higher concentrations of antibiotics needed under simulated lunar gravity with respect to simulated micro- and Martian gravities. Clinostat-produced results can be considered suggestive but not determinative of what might be expected in altered gravity, as there is still a need to systematically verify these simulation devices’ ability to accurately replicate phenomena observed in space. Nevertheless, this approach serves as a baseline to start interrogating key cellular and molecular aspects relevant to microbial processes on the lunar and Martian surfaces.

Biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in spaceflight is minimized on lubricant impregnated surfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10432549/,"The undesirable, yet inevitable, presence of bacterial biofilms in spacecraft poses a risk to the proper functioning of systems and to astronauts’ health. To mitigate the risks that arise from them, it is important to understand biofilms’ behavior in microgravity. As part of the Space Biofilms project, biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were grown in spaceflight over material surfaces. Stainless Steel 316 (SS316) and passivated SS316 were tested for their relevance as spaceflight hardware components, while a lubricant impregnated surface (LIS) was tested as potential biofilm control strategy. The morphology and gene expression of biofilms were characterized. Biofilms in microgravity are less robust than on Earth. LIS strongly inhibits biofilm formation compared to SS. Furthermore, this effect is even greater in spaceflight than on Earth, making LIS a promising option for spacecraft use. Transcriptomic profiles for the different conditions are presented, and potential mechanisms of biofilm reduction on LIS are discussed.

Competitive Growth Assay of Mutagenized Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Compatible With the International Space Station Veggie Plant Growth Chamber.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7261848/,"A biological life support system for spaceflight would capture carbon dioxide waste produced by living and working in space to generate useful organic compounds. Photosynthesis is the primary mechanism to fix carbon into organic molecules. Microalgae are highly efficient at converting light, water, and carbon dioxide into biomass, particularly under limiting, artificial light conditions that are a necessity in space photosynthetic production. Although there is great promise in developing algae for chemical or food production in space, most spaceflight algae growth studies have been conducted on solid agar-media to avoid handling liquids in microgravity. Here we report that breathable plastic tissue culture bags can support robust growth of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the Veggie plant growth chamber, which is used on the International Space Station (ISS) to grow terrestrial plants. Live cultures can be stored for at least 1 month in the bags at room temperature. The gene set required for growth in these photobioreactors was tested using a competitive growth assay with mutations induced by short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC) mutagenesis in either wild-type (CC-5082) or cw15 mutant (CC-1883) strains at the start of the assay. Genome sequencing identified UVC-induced mutations, which were enriched for transversions and non-synonymous mutations relative to natural variants among laboratory strains. Genes with mutations indicating positive selection were enriched for information processing genes related to DNA repair, RNA processing, translation, cytoskeletal motors, kinases, and ABC transporters. These data suggest that modification of DNA repair, signal transduction, and metabolite transport may be needed to improve growth rates in this spaceflight production system.

Spatial Characterization of Microbial Communities on Multi-Species Leafy Greens Grown Simultaneously in the Vegetable Production Systems on the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8537831/,"The establishment of steady-state continuous crop production during long-term deep space missions is critical for providing consistent nutritional and psychological benefits for the crew, potentially improving their health and performance. Three technology demonstrations were completed achieving simultaneous multi-species plant growth and the concurrent use of two Veggie units on the International Space Station (ISS). Microbiological characterization using molecular and culture-based methods was performed on leaves and roots from two harvests of three leafy greens, red romaine lettuce ( Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Outredgeous’); mizuna mustard, ( Brassica rapa var japonica ); and green leaf lettuce, ( Lactuca sativa cv. Waldmann’s) and associated rooting pillow components and Veggie chamber surfaces. Culture based enumeration and pathogen screening indicated the leafy greens were safe for consumption. Surface samples of the Veggie facility and plant pillows revealed low counts of bacteria and fungi and are commonly isolated on ISS. Community analysis was completed with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Comparisons between pillow components, and plant tissue types from VEG-03D, E, and F revealed higher diversity in roots and rooting substrate than the leaves and wick. This work provides valuable information for food production-related research on the ISS and the impact of the plant microbiome on this unique closed environment.

Response of Arabidopsis thaliana and Mizuna mustard seeds to simulated space radiation exposures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8879990/,"One of the major concerns for long-term exploration missions beyond the Earth’s magnetosphere is consequences from exposures to solar particle event (SPE) protons and galactic cosmic rays (GCR). For long-term crewed Lunar and Mars explorations, the production of fresh food in space will provide both nutritional supplements and psychological benefits to the astronauts. However, the effects of space radiation on plants and plant propagules have not been sufficiently investigated and characterized. In this study, we evaluated the effect of two different compositions of charged particles-simulated GCR, and simulated SPE protons on dry and hydrated seeds of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the crop plant Mizuna mustard [ Brassica rapa var. japonica ]. Exposures to charged particles, simulated GCRs (up to 80 cGy) or SPEs (up to 200 cGy), were performed either acutely or at a low dose rate using the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL). Control and irradiated seeds were planted in a solid phytogel and grown in a controlled environment. Five to seven days after planting, morphological parameters were measured to evaluate radiation-induced damage in the seedlings. After exposure to single types of charged particles, as well as to simulated GCR, the hydrated Arabidopsis seeds showed dose- and quality-dependent responses, with heavier ions causing more severe defects. Seeds exposed to simulated GCR (dry seeds) and SPE (hydrated seeds) had significant, although much less damage than seeds exposed to heavier and higher linear energy transfer (LET) particles. In general, the extent of damage depends on the seed type.

"In situ monitoring of barrier function on-chip via automated, non-invasive luminescence sensing.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11969330/,"Over the past 30 years, organs-on-a-chip (OOCs) have emerged as a robust alternative to address the technological challenges associated with current in vitro and in vivo options. Although OOCs offer improved bio-relevance and controlled complexity, broad adoption has remained limited. Most approaches to characterize on-chip structure and function require human intervention, limiting device translation and feasibility. Here, we introduce a new fiber optic-based sensing platform that enables automated, temporal luminescence sensing on-chip, validated for real-time readout of epithelial and endothelial barrier function under cytokine-induced inflammation.

37-day microgravity exposure in 16-week female C57BL/6J mice is associated with bone loss specific to weight-bearing skeletal sites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11940681/,"Exposure to weightlessness in microgravity and elevated space radiation are associated with rapid bone loss in mammals, but questions remain about their mechanisms of action and relative importance. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bone loss during spaceflight in Low Earth Orbit is primarily associated with site-specific microgravity unloading of weight-bearing sites in the skeleton. Microcomputed tomography and histological analyses of bones from mice space flown on ISS for 37 days in the NASA Rodent Research-1 experiment show significant site-specific cancellous and cortical bone loss occurring in the femur, but not in L2 vertebrae. The lack of bone degenerative effects in the spine in combination with same-animal paired losses in the femur suggests that space radiation levels in Low Earth Orbit or other systemic stresses are not likely to significantly contribute to the observed bone loss. Remarkably, spaceflight is also associated with accelerated progression of femoral head endochondral ossification. This suggests the microgravity environment promotes premature progression of secondary ossification during late stages of skeletal maturation at 21 weeks. Furthermore, mice housed in the NASA ISS Rodent Habitat during 1 g ground controls maintained or gained bone relative to mice housed in standard vivarium cages that showed significant bone mass declines. These findings suggest that housing in the Rodent Habitat with greater topological enrichment from 3D wire-mesh surfaces may promote increased mechanical loading of weight-bearing bones and maintenance of bone mass. In summary, our results indicate that in female mice approaching skeletal maturity, mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites is the major cause of bone loss in microgravity, while sites loaded predominantly by muscle activity, such as the spine, appear unaffected. Additionally, we identified early-onset of femoral head epiphyseal plate secondary ossification as a novel spaceflight skeletal unloading effect that may lead to premature long bone growth arrest in microgravity.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-plosone.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bb48/11940681/a16af642b57e/pone.0317307.g001.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bb48/11940681/01e42d620411/pone.0317307.g002.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bb48/11940681/3a8481e809d6/pone.0317307.g003.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bb48/11940681/880a04f648f2/pone.0317307.g004.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bb48/11940681/12859792907b/pone.0317307.g005.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bb48/11940681/b3b77c67cecd/pone.0317307.g006.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bb48/11940681/7d89a5da2201/pone.0317307.g007.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bb48/11940681/05d46baa24d8/pone.0317307.g008.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/bb48/11940681/722abbce48fd/pone.0317307.g009.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Effects of Space Flight on Inflammasome Activation in the Brain of Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11941215/,"Space flight exposes astronauts to stressors that alter the immune response, rendering them vulnerable to infections and diseases. In this study, we aimed to determine the levels of inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. C57BL/6 mice were launched to the ISS as part of NASA’s Rodent Research 1 Mission on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft from 21 September 2014 to 25 October 2014. Dissected mouse brains from that mission were analyzed by immunoblotting of inflammasome signaling proteins and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) for inflammatory cytokine levels. Our data indicate decreased inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the ISS for 37 days when compared to the brains of mice that were maintained on the ground, and in mice corresponding to the baseline group that were sacrificed at the time of launching of SpaceX-4. Moreover, we did not detect any significant changes in the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10 between the ground control and the flight groups. Together, these studies suggest that spaceflight results in a decrease in the levels of innate immune signaling molecules that govern inflammasome signaling in the brain of mice.

Immunization induces inflammation in the mouse heart during spaceflight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11892206/,"Space travel is a growing area of interest and includes initiatives such as NASA’s Moon-to-Mars Mission. Reports on the cardiovascular effects of space travel reveal changes in morphology, metabolism, and function of the cardiovascular system. In this study, the cardiovascular response to immunization in space was studied in mice which were housed and immunized while on the International Space Station (ISS). Mice were immunized with tetanus toxoid combined with the adjuvant CpG (TT + CpG) and the effects of vaccination in space were studied using transcriptomics. Analysis of the mouse heart transcriptome was performed on flight control and flight-immunized mice. The results show that immunization aboard the ISS stimulates heightened inflammation in the heart via induction of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway to promote the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ, IL-17 and IL-6. Additional transcriptomic changes included alterations in the cytoskeleton and in the expression of transcripts associated with protection from oxidative stress. In summary, inflammation in the heart can occur following immunization in space. This investigation explores the impact of immune challenges on the heart and lays the groundwork for future research into additional cardiac alterations which can occur during spaceflight.","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-bmcgeno.png"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/415e/11892206/b21d2c4af106/12864_2025_11426_Fig1_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/415e/11892206/4c85f270eb0c/12864_2025_11426_Fig2_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/415e/11892206/6e5a43a742bf/12864_2025_11426_Fig3_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/415e/11892206/3dea59e29ef3/12864_2025_11426_Fig4_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/415e/11892206/c1a047dccdb2/12864_2025_11426_Fig5_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/415e/11892206/0ebcde58f30f/12864_2025_11426_Fig6_HTML.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
Analyzing the relationship between gene expression and phenotype in space-flown mice using a causal inference machine learning ensemble.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11748630/,"Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on human and rodent health. For example, liver dysfunction is a common phenotype observed in space-flown rodents, and this dysfunction is partially reflected in transcriptomic changes. Studies linking transcriptomics with liver dysfunction rely on tools which exploit correlation, but these tools make no attempt to disambiguate true correlations from spurious ones. In this work, we use a machine learning ensemble of causal inference methods called the Causal Research and Inference Search Platform (CRISP) which was developed to predict causal features of a binary response variable from high-dimensional input. We used CRISP to identify genes robustly correlated with a lipid density phenotype using transcriptomic and histological data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR). Our approach identified genes and molecular targets not predicted by previous traditional differential gene expression analyses. These genes are likely to play a pivotal role in the liver dysfunction observed in space-flown rodents, and this work opens the door to identifying novel countermeasures for space travel.

Sex-specific cardiovascular adaptations to simulated microgravity in Sprague-Dawley rats,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11659408/,"Men and women have different cardiovascular responses to spaceflight; however, few studies have focused on direct comparisons between sexes. We investigated the mechanisms of aortic stiffening in socially and sexually mature 20-week-old male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats exposed to hindlimb unloading (HLU) for 14 days. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was greater in the aortic arch of females after HLU versus control females ( n = 6–8). HLU had no effect on aortic PWV in males ( n = 5–6). Aortic α smooth muscle actin, myosin, collagen, elastin, and collagen-to-elastin ratio were not different in rats of either sex following HLU. The levels of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) were lower in the aorta of SD females exposed to HLU compared with female controls but were not altered in males. HLU females also had lower aortic PPARγ, increased oxidative stress markers, and diastolic dysfunction compared with control females. GPER agonist G1 prevented the increase in PWV and 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine without altering PPARγ or p47phox in HLU females ( n = 4 in each group) suggesting that lower GPER may contribute to arterial stiffening in the setting of simulated microgravity. This study highlights sex-specific vascular adaptations to the state of simulated microgravity.

Artificial gravity attenuates the transcriptomic response to spaceflight in the optic nerve and retina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11593819/,"The development of eye pathology is a serious concern for astronauts who spend time in deep space. Microgravity is a major component of the spaceflight environment which could have adverse effects on ocular health. The use of centrifugation to exert forces that partially or fully mimic Earth-level gravity in space is a possible countermeasure to mitigate the effects of microgravity on the eye. Therefore, we subjected mice on the International Space Station (ISS) to microgravity (0 G) or artificial gravity by centrifugation at 0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G, and then performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on optic nerve and retinal tissue after returning them to Earth alive. We find that the microgravity environment induces transcriptomic changes in the optic nerve and retina consistent with an increased oxidative stress load, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress. We also find that adding artificial gravity on board the ISS attenuates the transcriptomic response to microgravity in a dose-dependent manner. Such attenuation may effectively protect from and mitigate spaceflight-induced detrimental effects on ocular tissue.

Effect of simulated cosmic radiation on cytomegalovirus reactivation and lytic replication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11477029/,"Human exploration of the solar system will expose crew members to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), with a potential for adverse health effects. GCR particles (protons and ions) move at nearly the speed of light and easily penetrate space station walls, as well as the human body. Previously, we have shown reactivation of latent herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus, Epstein–Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), during stays at the International Space Station. Given the prevalence of latent CMV and the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating latent CMV. Latently infected Kasumi cells with CMV were irradiated with 137 Cs gamma rays, 150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, 600 MeV/n iron ions, proton ions, and simulated GCR. The CMV copy number increased significantly in the cells exposed to radiation as compared with the non-irradiated controls. Viral genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. However, transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of transcription of the UL49 ORF, implicating it in the switch from latent to lytic replication. These findings support our hypothesis that GCR may be a strong contributor to the reactivation of CMV infection seen in ISS crew members.

Protein kinase 2 of the giant sarcomeric protein UNC-89 regulates mitochondrial morphology and function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11487192/,"UNC-89 is a giant sarcomeric M-line protein required for sarcomere organization and optimal muscle function. UNC-89 contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and PK2, separated by an elastic region. Here we show that PK2 is a canonical kinase expected to be catalytically active. C. elegans expressing UNC-89 with a lysine to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria, correlated with more mitochondrially-associated DRP-1. PK2 KtoA mutants have increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis and altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. Muscle mitochondria show increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration, each of which cannot be uncoupled. This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting from an increased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria, to help match energy requirements with energy production.

Spaceflight alters host-gut microbiota interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11362537/,"The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of spaceflight on mammals, inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy. Although these physiological responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiota interactions during spaceflight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota and host gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight using multiomics. Metagenomics revealed significant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis . Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. Host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression. These changes imply that interactions at the host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceflight pathology and that these interactions might critically influence human health and long-duration spaceflight feasibility.

Discoveries from human stem cell research in space that are relevant to advancing cellular therapies on Earth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11339457/,"Stem cell research performed in space has provided fundamental insights into stem cell properties and behavior in microgravity including cell proliferation, differentiation, and regeneration capabilities. However, there is broader scientific value to this research including potential translation of stem cell research in space to clinical applications. Here, we present important discoveries from different studies performed in space demonstrating the potential use of human stem cells as well as the limitations in cellular therapeutics. A full understanding of the effects of microgravity in space on potentially supporting the expansion and/or enhancement of stem cell function is required to translate the findings into clinics.

Simulated microgravity impairs human NK [natural killer] cell cytotoxic activity against space radiation-relevant leukemic cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11324864/,"Natural killer (NK) cells are an important first-line of defense against malignant cells. Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity present during spaceflight affects the body’s defenses against leukemogenesis. Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (sμG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous sμG. This brief exposure to sμG markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous sμG. RNA-seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which sμG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that μG may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO.

Simulated microgravity alters gene regulation linked to immunity and cardiovascular disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11353732/,"Microgravity exposure induces a cephalad fluid shift and an overall reduction in physical activity levels which can lead to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of countermeasures. Future spaceflight missions will expose crew to extended periods of microgravity among other stressors, the effects of which on cardiovascular health are not fully known. In this study, we determined cardiac responses to extended microgravity exposure using the rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model. We hypothesized that exposure to prolonged simulated microgravity and subsequent recovery would lead to increased oxidative damage and altered expression of genes involved in the oxidative response. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts of male (three and nine months of age) and female (3 months of age) Long–Evans rats that underwent HU for various durations up to 90 days and reambulated up to 90 days post-HU. Results indicate sex-dependent changes in oxidative damage marker 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and antioxidant gene expression in left ventricular tissue. Three-month-old females displayed elevated 8-OHdG levels after 14 days of HU while age-matched males did not. In nine-month-old males, there were no differences in 8-OHdG levels between HU and normally loaded control males at any of the timepoints tested following HU. RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space.

Spaceflight increases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak and this cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11271499/,"Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca 2+ dysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca 2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-flown mice, the Ca 2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III) meso -tetrakis( N -n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca 2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In conclusion, we find that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca 2+ leak that cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment. Future work should investigate alternative therapeutics that are specifically aimed at increasing SERCA activation or reducing Ca 2+ leak.
Subject terms: Calcium channels, Physiology
Exposure to microgravity, and subsequent muscle unloading, is known to cause extensive muscle weakness and atrophy, especially to postural muscles such as the soleus 1 – 6 . Recent work has demonstrated that muscle weakness precedes muscle atrophy 4 and was thought to be due, at least in part, to Ca 2+ dysregulation 7 . Using soleus muscle samples from the rodent research (RR) -1 and -9 missions, we demonstrated the Ca 2+ uptake ability of the sarco (endo)plasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump to be severely impaired following ~1 month of spaceflight 5 . In muscle, SERCA is responsible for maintaining low intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations ([Ca 2+ ] i ) by bringing Ca 2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) 8 , 9 . Impaired SERCA function can result in high [Ca 2+ ] i , leading to elevated RONS, increased protein degradation, cell death, and muscle weakness and atrophy 10 – 14 . Structurally, SERCA pumps are highly susceptible to post-translational modifications (e.g., tyrosine nitration, cysteine nitrosylation) from elevated RONS that will impair its catalytic activity 5 , 15 – 22 . The ensuing elevated [Ca 2+ ] i will not only lead to muscle damage but can also further increase RONS production 23 – 25 creating a negative cyclic relationship that perpetuates muscle pathology.
While damaging at high concentrations, RONS are important signaling molecules at low concentrations 26 . Superoxide dismutases (SOD) are a family of enzymes that maintain physiological RONS concentrations by scavenging and neutralizing highly reactive superoxide molecules (for review, see ref. 27 ). Mice deficient of SOD show impaired SERCA activity, muscle weakness, and atrophy 11 , 20 , 22 ; but, the pharmacological activation of SERCA can reduce mitochondrial RONS production and attenuate muscle atrophy despite increased oxidative stress 11 , 12 . Thus, targeting SERCA, either through genetic overexpression or pharmacological intervention, may be a viable target to attenuate muscle atrophy and weakness. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with Manganese(III) meso -tetrakis( N -n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE, also seen as BMX-001), an antioxidant that acts as a SOD mimetic 28 , 29 , could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction in the murine soleus muscle following 35 days of spaceflight. BuOE has been effective in reducing oxidative stress in various animal models of radiation-induced injury 30 – 33 , a relevant injury mechanism to spaceflight, providing strong rationale for the investigation of its effectiveness in the present study.
Following 35 days of exposure to microgravity, absolute soleus weight was significantly reduced in the flight groups compared to GC/VIV groups ( p = 0.0005) with no effect of BuOE treatment (Fig. 1A ). No effects of flight or treatment were observed on body weight (Fig. 1B ) resulting in a main effect of flight reducing the soleus:body weight ratio ( p = 0.0053, Fig. 1C ).","[""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/ncbi-logos/nih-nlm-ncbi--white.svg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg"", ""data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIGhlaWdodD0iMjQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNCAyNCIgd2lkdGg9IjI0Ij48cGF0aCBkPSJNMCAwaDI0djI0SDB6IiBmaWxsPSJub25lIi8+PHBhdGggZmlsbD0iI2ZmZiIgZD0iTTE1LjUgMTRoLS43OWwtLjI4LS4yN0E2LjQ3MSA2LjQ3MSAwIDAgMCAxNiA5LjUgNi41IDYuNSAwIDEgMCA5LjUgMTZjMS42MSAwIDMuMDktLjU5IDQuMjMtMS41N2wuMjcuMjh2Ljc5bDUgNC45OUwyMC40OSAxOWwtNC45OS01em0tNiAwQzcuMDEgMTQgNSAxMS45OSA1IDkuNVM3LjAxIDUgOS41IDUgMTQgNy4wMSAxNCA5LjUgMTEuOTkgMTQgOS41IDE0eiIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons-bg/search--white.svg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/banners/logo-npjmicrogr.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6419/11271499/1f042e6ff875/41526_2024_419_Fig1_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6419/11271499/765e7dc83e96/41526_2024_419_Fig2_HTML.jpg"", ""https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/6419/11271499/7de36f626bd7/41526_2024_419_Fig3_HTML.jpg"", ""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/usa-icons/close.svg""]",[]
